They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.

The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a ""dirty little Cinderella"" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the stepmother and the two limping sisters horror, their merely servant-girl had win without any subterfuge. Both the parents and the two sisters would have killed Aschenputtel, but the prince put her before him on his horse and rode off to the palace. While passing the hazel tree the two magic doves from heaven declare Aschenputtel as the true bride of the prince, and remained on her shoulders, one on the left and the other on the right.","A rich man has two daughters. The first is beautiful, the second is beautiful and the third is beautiful. When the daughters are sick, the mother-in-law asks Aschenputtel if she can take them back to the house.

They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's pigeon coop.

The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch.

A customer soon entered the store and offered more than the usual price, for he was fond of the pair.

Hiding in a corner of the room, they saw two little men working quickly and nimbly on the shoes, then running away after their work was completely finished.

A poor hardworking servant girl was sweeping out the house and shaking the sweepings onto a large pile when she found a letter on the pile. Since she could not read, the servant took the letter to her masters. They told her that she had been invited to an elf baptism and asked to become the godmother of the child. The girl hesitated at first, but her master finally convinced her to accept.

Then the servant girl was led by the elves to their hollow mountain, where everything was smaller but also more splendidly ornamented.

The elves did everything to make her happy during those three days, but the girl again asked to leave. The little men gave her gold and let her leave their mountain.

A woman had her child taken from the cradle by elves and substituted with a changeling. Her neighbour advised her to set the changeling on the hearth, make a fire, and boil water in two eggshells: that should make the changeling laugh, and if he laughs it will be all over with him.

A poor hardworking shoemaker had so little leather that he could only make a single pair of shoes. One evening, leaving the pair with the work unfinished, he went to bed and commended himself to God. After waking up the next morning and saying his prayers, he found the shoes completely finished and perfectly well-made in his workbench. A customer soon entered the store and offered more than the usual price, for he was fond of the pair. One evening, shortly before Christmas, the shoemaker said to his wife, ""Why don't we stay up tonight and see who is giving us this helping hand,"" and his wife agreed. Hiding in a corner of the room, they saw two little men working quickly and nimbly on the shoes, then running away after their work was completely finished.

The next morning, his wife said, ""The little men have made us wealthy. We must show them our thanks. They are running around with nothing on, freezing.""

After having given up, he sits awaiting his demise when he overhears a goose complaining about a ring stuck in her throat. The servant leaps up, grabs the goose and hurries to the kitchen, where the cook slits the goose's neck and reveals the missing gold ring. The King apologizes and offers the servant land and riches.

He also adds that the young man must either bring the ring back, drown while getting the ring, or be drowned upon returning without it.

Astonished, the King agrees to the marriage of his daughter to the servant.

When he wakes, he is surprised to find all the sacks are now refilled, with not one grain missing. The ant king had all of the ants working the entire night to fill them.
Still not satisfied, the princess sends the servant off on to bring her an apple from the Tree of Life. The servant does not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he sets off anyway. After a long journey, he encounters the three raven fledglings, who have flown to the end of the world, where the Tree stands, and retrieved the apple for him. The servant takes the apple to the princess and shares it with her, and the two are happily married.","One of the servants hides the bowl from the king's table.

2.0,1.5,2.5,1.5,250.0,10,2,"There once was a prince who decided to go on a journey with his servant.  In a dark forest, they came to a small house, where a maiden warned them that her stepmother was a witch who disliked strangers, but unfortunately there was nowhere else for shelter.  The prince and his servant reluctantly entered the witch's house, but before they went to bed, the maiden warned the prince and his servant not to eat or drink anything the witch gave them because it might be poisonous. The next morning, the witch gave the prince's servant a poisonous drink, telling him to give it to his master, but the servant ended up spilling it on the prince's horse, killing it.
When he told the prince what had happened and they came to the dead horse, a raven was already eating the corpse. Deciding they may not find better food that day, the servant killed the bird and took it with him. Next, they reached an inn and the servant gave the innkeeper the raven to make food of it. Unknown to the prince and his servant, the inn was really a robbers' den. The robbers returned, and, before killing the travellers, sat down to eat. Immediately after eating a few bites of the raven soup the innkeeper had prepared, the robbers fell down dead from the poison that the raven had in its body. The innkeeper's daughter then showed the prince and his servant the robbers' hidden treasure, but the prince insisted that the daughter keep it.
Continuing on, the prince and his servant next came to a town where a princess would marry any man who asked her a riddle that she could not solve. If she could solve it, the man's head would be cut off. The prince asked the princess, ""What slew none, and yet slew twelve?"" The princess could not solve the riddle, so she sent her maid to see if the prince revealed the riddle while talking in his sleep. The prince was prepared, however, because that night he had his servant sleep in his bed. When the maid came in, the servant ripped off her robe and chased her out.  Next, the princess sent her chambermaid to spy on the prince while he was asleep, but the prince's servant also ripped off her robe and chased her out.

The prince and his servant reluctantly entered the witch's house, but before they went to bed, the maiden warned the prince and his servant not to eat or drink anything the witch gave them because it might be poisonous. The next morning, the witch gave the prince's servant a poisonous drink, telling him to give it to his master, but the servant ended up spilling it on the prince's horse, killing it.

In a dark forest, they came to a small house, where a maiden warned them that her stepmother was a witch who disliked strangers, but unfortunately there was nowhere else for shelter.  The prince and his servant reluctantly entered the witch's house, but before they went to bed, the maiden warned the prince and his servant not to eat or drink anything the witch gave them because it might be poisonous. The next morning, the witch gave the prince's servant a poisonous drink, telling him to give it to his master, but the servant ended up spilling it on the prince's horse, killing it.
When he told the prince what had happened and they came to the dead horse, a raven was already eating the corpse. Deciding they may not find better food that day, the servant killed the bird and took it with him. Next, they reached an inn and the servant gave the innkeeper the raven to make food of it. Unknown to the prince and his servant, the inn was really a robbers' den. The robbers returned, and, before killing the travellers, sat down to eat. Immediately after eating a few bites of the raven soup the innkeeper had prepared, the robbers fell down dead from the poison that the raven had in its body. The innkeeper's daughter then showed the prince and his servant the robbers' hidden treasure, but the prince insisted that the daughter keep it.
Continuing on, the prince and his servant next came to a town where a princess would marry any man who asked her a riddle that she could not solve. If she could solve it, the man's head would be cut off. The prince asked the princess, ""What slew none, and yet slew twelve?""

Next, the princess sent her chambermaid to spy on the prince while he was asleep, but the prince's servant also ripped off her robe and chased her out. On the third night, the prince slept in his own bed, and the princess herself came in. The prince pretended to be asleep and the princess asked him the answer to the riddle. After the prince revealed the answer, the princess departed, but left her robe behind.
The next morning, the princess announced the answer of the riddle: ""A raven ate from a dead, poisoned horse, and died from it. Then, twelve robbers ate the raven and died from that.""

She calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast.

The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch.

The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a ""dirty little Cinderella"" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the stepmother and the two limping sisters horror, their merely servant-girl had win without any subterfuge. Both the parents and the two sisters would have killed Aschenputtel, but the prince put her before him on his horse and rode off to the palace.

The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.

The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a ""dirty little Cinderella"" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the stepmother and the two limping sisters horror, their merely servant-girl had win without any subterfuge. Both the parents and the two sisters would have killed Aschenputtel, but the prince put her before him on his horse and rode off to the palace. While passing the hazel tree the two magic doves from heaven declare Aschenputtel as the true bride of the prince, and remained on her shoulders, one on the left and the other on the right.","A rich man and his wife have a daughter. When the daughter is sick, the man asks her to leave him, but when she is up in the air, she sees her sisters dancing on her grave, and when she gets twelve beaten, she wants to have it. When she is in the house, the mother tells her daughter to stay pious and good. The son falls asleep and the sisters go to bed with him. The mother has two daughters, one of whom is beautiful, the other beautiful, and the third beautiful. The sisters tell him that they will marry him if he marries them. When he is asleep, he has to go to the house of his mother, but the mother does not know him. She tells him that she is a princess and that she will be his wife if he does not marry her. The second sister tells the son that the princess has been married to a beautiful princess, but she does not recognize him. He goes to his house and finds her in a basket full of rags. She cuts off the rags from the basket, but he is not allowed to touch the basket until twelve hands are in the basket. She goes to the prince's house and asks for a dress that is more beautiful than that of her mother. The princess's sisters ask for a pair of gowns, which she will wear if she is able to get dressed. The eldest sister gives her gown and the eldest brother a gown. The youngest sister gives it to the king and the king's daughters. The two sisters marry each other. The king and his daughters are married. The first sisters get married and the second sister is married. When they are married, the king has to marry the daughters of the prince. The daughters have to be dressed in the same way as the other sisters, but they do not know each other's clothes or clothes. The older sisters dress the daughter in the dress and the younger sister dresses the daughter with the gown, which is the same as the oldest sisters.

Then, she says to herself, ""How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony."" Sometime later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth.A year later, Snow White's father, the king, marries again. His new wife is a very beautiful, but also vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that response because the magic mirror never lies. But when Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White learns of her stepmother's evil plan she tearfully begs the huntsman, ""Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!"" After seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of an animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once again: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once again: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

Franz Jüttner's illustrations from Sneewittchen (1905)","A princess sees three drops of blood fall into the snow, and because it looks so beautiful in the white, she thinks that she should give birth to a child so white as snow, so red as blood, and so black as the frame. The princess has a daughter named Sneevich, who is the most beautiful woman in the country. When she grows up, the mirror asks: ""Spieglein, Spieglein an der Wand: wer ist die schön in all dem Land?"", ""Frau Königin, ihr seidchen ist noch tausendmal schöner als ihr!"". When the princess hears the mirror, she becomes angry, and hates the prince, thinking that she is no longer the world's most beautiful. She calls out to a hunter to cut off the apple and eat it in the forest. The hunter wants to kill him, but the huntsman wants to make him eat the other half of the apple, which is poisonous. The prince lets him sleep in the bed, and the seventh dwarf stays with him every hour. The dwarfs come home, and they ask who has been in the house and who has died. When they hear that the dwarf is still alive, they ask why he is alive. The queen's mother is burned to death, and she is allowed to be buried there for three days. The king's daughter, however, does not want to be allowed to live without the apple.",hDE-EN,0.2678440029433406,0.1427520235467255,0.5729555,0.5576749,0.56521195,-3.3965561389923096,0.5670095437083302,-0.6581971,52-7,2.9214922585859533,0.9588912725448608,0.2433123758316601,0.4628332156607141,0.4262464090225384,9.5

2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,228.0,7,2,"A father had two sons. The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","There are two brothers who live happily in the world of dumb people. The oldest has a pitcher before his head and the younger has a plank in front of his head. His father, the dumb hamster, wants him to learn the tricks. The next time, the hamster learns how to steal it from the castle, where a dog bleaks his teeth and his tongue hangs out. The king's daughter, the queen's mother, is given the task of bringing the ghosts to her. When the king asks him what he wants to do with it, he answers: ""What do you do when you have no money?"". Then, when the king agrees, the servant tells him: ""I want to get you a fire, a pot, a spinning wheel, a chair, and a table."" Then, the innkeeper tells the servant that he has a goose's throat. The innkeeper's brother, the poor hamster's father, laughs at him and wants to learn how to get it from him. When he hears a story of a fairy tale, he grumbles at night. When his brother, Hans Dampf, hears about the grusels, he is frightened by them. He goes to the inn to get his money, but when he has no money, he gets stuck in the house of his father, who has promised to give it to his father. He climbs into the inn with his knife and cuts off the heads of the cats, and the dog bites off the top of the head. He is not able to do enough to get the goose out of the house, so he goes back to his old inn, where he lives for three nights. Then he meets his father's wife, who gives him his bride. When they meet, Hans dazzles at the inn's window, and Hans is told that he will not be able to get any more than one night's worth of food.

2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,228.0,7,3,"A father had two sons. The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.

They set him to prove himself by stealing an ox that a man brought to market to sell.  He took a shoe with a silver buckle and left it in the road.  The man saw it and thought it would be good if only he had the other, and went on.  The son took the shoe and ran through the countryside, to leave it in the road again. The man left his ox and went back to find the other, and the son drove the ox off.
The man went back to get the second ox to sell it, and the robbers told the son that if he stole that one as well, they would take him into the band.  The son hanged himself up along the way, and when the man passed, ran on and hanged himself again, and then a third time, until the man was half-convinced that it was witchcraft and went back to see if the first two bodies were still hanging, and the son drove off his ox.

The robbers were not pleased with his leading the band, and so they all left him.  The son drove the oxen out, so they returned to their owner, took all the treasure in the house, and returned to his father.
He decided to marry the daughter of a local squire and sent his father to ask for her hand, telling him to tell the squire that he was a Master Thief.  The squire agreed, if the son could steal the roast from the spit on Sunday.  The son caught three hares and released them near the squire's kitchen, and the people there, thinking it was one hare, went out to catch it, and the son got in and stole the roast.

The Master Thief dressed up as an angel and convinced the priest that he was come to take him to heaven.

The Master Thief said that he could not, because he had to keep the mead from spilling, and the squire took his place and lent him his horse to look.

The man left his ox and went back to find the other, and the son drove the ox off.
The man went back to get the second ox to sell it, and the robbers told the son that if he stole that one as well, they would take him into the band.  The son hanged himself up along the way, and when the man passed, ran on and hanged himself again, and then a third time, until the man was half-convinced that it was witchcraft and went back to see if the first two bodies were still hanging, and the son drove off his ox.
The man went for his third and last ox, and the robbers said that they would make him the band's leader if he stole it.  The son made a sound like an ox bellowing in the woods, and the man, thinking it was his stolen oxen, ran off, leaving the third behind, and the son stole that one as well.
The robbers were not pleased with his leading the band, and so they all left him.  The son drove the oxen out, so they returned to their owner, took all the treasure in the house, and returned to his father.
He decided to marry the daughter of a local squire and sent his father to ask for her hand, telling him to tell the squire that he was a Master Thief.  The squire agreed, if the son could steal the roast from the spit on Sunday.  The son caught three hares and released them near the squire's kitchen, and the people there, thinking it was one hare, went out to catch it, and the son got in and stole the roast.

The priest made fun of him, and when the Master Thief came to claim his reward, the squire asked him to prove his skill further, by playing some trick on the priest. The Master Thief dressed up as an angel and convinced the priest that he was come to take him to heaven.  He dragged the priest over stones and thorns and threw him into the goose-house, telling him it was purgatory, and then stole all his treasure.
The squire was pleased, but still put off the Master Thief, telling him to steal twelve horses from his stable, with twelve grooms in their saddles.  The Master Thief prepared and disguised himself as an old woman to take shelter in the stable, and when the night grew cold, drank brandy against it.  The grooms demanded some, and he gave them a drugged drink, putting them to sleep, and stole the horses.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal a horse while he was riding it.  The Master Thief said he could, and disguised himself as an old man with a cask of mead, and put his finger in the hole, in place of the tap.  The squire rode up and asked him if he would look in the woods, to be sure that the Master Thief did not lurk there.  The Master Thief said that he could not, because he had to keep the mead from spilling, and the squire took his place and lent him his horse to look.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal the sheet off his bed and his wife's shift. The Master Thief made up a dummy like a man and put it at the window, and the squire shot at it.  The Master Thief let it drop.  Fearing talk, the squire went to bury it, and the Master Thief, pretending to be the squire, got the sheet and the shift on the pretext they were needed to clean the blood up.
The squire decided that he was too afraid of what the thief would steal next, and let him marry his daughter.","An old man and his wife come to a rich gentleman who wants to serve him as a master thief.

2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,4.0,6,2,"A father had two sons. The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","A king has a daughter, the most beautiful of all daughters, who guards his castle for three nights.

2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,6,3,"A father had two sons. The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons.

They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch.

The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a ""dirty little Cinderella"" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the stepmother and the two limping sisters horror, their merely servant-girl had win without any subterfuge. Both the parents and the two sisters would have killed Aschenputtel, but the prince put her before him on his horse and rode off to the palace.

She calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast.

The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch.

His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters.

The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils.

The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him.

While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils.

The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.

The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled.

The prince was prepared, however, because that night he had his servant sleep in his bed. When the maid came in, the servant ripped off her robe and chased her out.  Next, the princess sent her chambermaid to spy on the prince while he was asleep, but the prince's servant also ripped off her robe and chased her out. On the third night, the prince slept in his own bed, and the princess herself came in. The prince pretended to be asleep and the princess asked him the answer to the riddle. After the prince revealed the answer, the princess departed, but left her robe behind.
The next morning, the princess announced the answer of the riddle: ""A raven ate from a dead, poisoned horse, and died from it. Then, twelve robbers ate the raven and died from that."" The prince declared that the princess had not solved the riddle herself, but rather questioned him in his sleep. The town judges asked for proof, and the prince showed them the three robes. The judges ordered the princess's robe to be embroidered with gold and silver, for it was to be her wedding robe.","There was a royal sister who was proud and didn’t know what to start before the high mouth, and eventually went so far that a command was made, that the one who made a puzzle that could advise him would have lost his life for it. But if she didn’t get it, she also wanted to be her companion.

But if she didn’t get it, she also wanted to be her companion. Now she was beautiful like milk and blood, that no one looked at the danger, and one after the other came with his mystery, but she redeemed it every time. And when they had made a good cloth for each other, it came to pass that a merchant son heard of the commandment and decided to go with him, and his servant, who was wise, should go with him and help him. Four eyes, he thought, see more comfortable than two, we want to be beautifully hit, fresh bold, is half won. But the Father and Mother, as they heard of it, were in great faithfulness, and because they believed that their beloved child must die there, they did not want to let their children go and said, “It is better that he dies and be buried with us than in the stranger.” Thus they drowned poison into the goodbye wine and said, “Love Son, drink for the last time with us,” but it was as if he noticed the intentions, because he didn’t want to drink, but he raised the horse and said: “Lives a week, dear parents, I have to go, and another wins the beautiful Virgin.” Then they raised the glass to him, that he should drink with force; but he gave the horse the sporns, that the wine sprinkled and sprinkled the horse into the ear. When they had run for a while, the horse fell away, and the Lord wanted to sit on the servant’s horse, and the servant had to walk behind the three and carry the bond on his back. Now the rabbits lay down on the dead horse and eat it, but because the flesh was poisoned, they will also be poisoned and soon die. Then the servant raised up three of the dead rabbs, and took them with him into the house of the residence, and thought that it should feed the peasants. And he gave them a little hake and baked three bread from it. The next morning they came through a forest in a thick cloud, where twelve spiders jumped and held the Lord and the servants. The servant said, “Let us live, we have no money, but three breads we will give you.” Those were satisfied, they took the bread, they shared among themselves and ate them. Not long, she met the poison, and all the twelve fell dead from the earth. Now the two ran into the city and the young merchant stood before the queen and said he wanted to give up a puzzle. He said, “On one blow one, on two blow three, on three blow twelve: how is this to be solved?” The royal daughters wiped up, but they could not bring out the mystery. She sought in her mystery books, but it wasn’t in it. Now she had three days of time, and in the first night she sent her womb into the Lord’s bedroom, which should obey if he did not speak of it in the sleep. But the servant was wise, and had placed himself in the bed at the place of his Lord; and when the shepherd came, he took the clothes that she had worn, and hunted her with roots. He put the clothes in his runzel. In the two nights the princes sent their Chamber Jews, but the servant took the clothes and continued to hunt them with routes. But in the third night the king's daughters came and had a cloudy gray dress and sat on the Lord's bed. And when she thought he was dreaming, she spoke to Eichen and hoped that he would answer in the dream, but he was awake and understood and heard everything every week. Then he said, “On [126] a blow one, what is this?” He answered, “My horse, which fell from the poison that was hit in his ear.” – “On two slacks three: what is this?” “Three rabbits who eat from the poisoned horse and die from it.” – “On three strikes twelve: what is this?” “Twelve spiders who ate the poisoned rabbits that were broken into three breads and died of it.” When she knew the mystery, she wanted to go on again, but he kept the gray dress, so that she had to leave it. The next morning she said, “I’ve guessed the mystery,” and let the twelve judges come and solve it before them. But the young man asked for an ear from them and said, ""If they had not gotten in the night and had asked me, they would not know."" They said to him, “Let us bring signs.” Then the servant showed the three clothes, and when the judges saw and noticed the cloudy gray, they said, “Let the clothes stick!” Then they were dressed in a wedding dress and gave him the king's daughters.",hDE-EN,0.4602851323828921,0.2104548540393754,0.526168,0.53525364,0.53067195,-3.1431314945220947,0.5537825571778989,-0.8661882,250-German_25-True-True-True,0.0,0.9074822068214417,0.1454744676834984,0.3860539661525787,0.3459573830743987,14.5

She calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.

The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a ""dirty little Cinderella"" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the stepmother and the two limping sisters horror, their merely servant-girl had win without any subterfuge. Both the parents and the two sisters would have killed Aschenputtel, but the prince put her before him on his horse and rode off to the palace. While passing the hazel tree the two magic doves from heaven declare Aschenputtel as the true bride of the prince, and remained on her shoulders, one on the left and the other on the right.","Once upon a time, there was a wealthy man who lived happily with his wife and their daughter. When the wife became terminally ill, she told her daughter to plant a tree on her grave and to shake it if she ever needed anything. After the wife passed away, the man remarried and his new wife had two daughters who were cruel to the daughter. They made her work in the kitchen and gave her an old dress to wear. When the king held a ball, the stepsisters went and left the daughter behind. With the help of two doves, she was able to attend the ball and dance with the prince.

1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,10,8,"A father had two sons. The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","A king had a daughter, the beautifulst princess in the world, and had promised to marry the princess. But a young merchant refused and offered to wander three nights into the castle. In the middle of the night, he made himself a fire, a wooden board, and a fire. One of his legs came underneath the stone, and the other a little bit too little. The merchant complained that the sound was too loud and that the legs were missing, but the merchant turned them back and turned them into balls. Then two cats came to the fire, shouting that they were going to play. He cut off the nails that he had cut, then killed them. He threw them into a pond, where he found them in the pond. When he reached his sleep, he threw his knife at the edge and threw it away. The next morning, he went to sleep. The third night, the king saw how it was going to be done, and he went back to sleep the next night.

The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that response because the magic mirror never lies. But when Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White learns of her stepmother's evil plan she tearfully begs the huntsman, ""Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!"" After seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of an animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once again: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep.

Shortly afterwards the servant is accused of stealing the Queen's ring. He is given one day to prove his innocence or submit to punishment. After having given up, he sits awaiting his demise when he overhears a goose complaining about a ring stuck in her throat. The servant leaps up, grabs the goose and hurries to the kitchen, where the cook slits the goose's neck and reveals the missing gold ring. The King apologizes and offers the servant land and riches. The servant declines, accepting only a little gold and a horse on which to see the world.
On his journey to another town in another kingdom, the servant first encounters a number of animals in distress, including three fish out of water, ants at risk of being trodden upon, and starving raven fledglings in a nest.

In the next town, the servant learns that the King has announced that he wishes to marry off his daughter, but any suitor must agree to complete an arduous task to the end or be put to death. After one glimpse of the beautiful girl, the young man agrees. The King tosses a golden ring into the sea and tells the young man to retrieve it.

They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils.

The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him.

The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled.

As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White learns of her stepmother's evil plan she tearfully begs the huntsman, ""Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!"" After seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of an animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once again: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","One of the older brothers, the youngest, has a board in front of his head.

He has to learn to ride a tawgy ox in his room, and when he learns to ride it, he rides it like a steep carriage. He wants to have a good night's rest, and he has to go back to his castle. The next time, the king comes to him and asks why he had to go up there. He tells the king that he must go up to his bed at night. The third time, when he comes to his house, he asks his father for his money. He gives him a piece of gold, which he will take with him to the fire, and then he goes up to a corner of the fire.

During this hike, one evening he and a circular smith accompanying him stop at an inn, where he meets a student and a wagoner. This inn is located in the Spessart region, which is notorious for robberies. The four men decide not to go to bed in order to avoid being robbed. In order not to be overcome by sleep, they tell each other four fairy tales. Around 10:00 p.m. a countess comes to the inn together with her huntsman and her lady-in-waiting. The men inform the huntsman of the impending danger. Therefore, the countess goes to a room with her lady and the hunter joins the men to have better chances of defense in case of an attack.
After midnight, the robbers do indeed arrive. However, they are only after the countess. The robbers want to kidnap her so that her husband will have to ransom her. The young goldsmith, who is small and has no beard, lets himself be ""kidnapped"" instead of her, disguised as the countess. The hunter and the student get themselves captured with the goldsmith and accompany him.
While the countess goes back home unharmed and the carter continues on his way, the three prisoners are taken to the campsite of the band of robbers. After they have held out there for five days, the robber chief comes to them and explains how serious the situation is. The count does not pay the ransom, so the captain is forced to inflict pain on the supposed countess. However, it seems impossible for the robber captain to put the countess in danger, as he respects her very much. Therefore, he proposes to the prisoners to escape together with them as soon as it gets dark. So the goldsmith, the huntsman, the student and the captain wander all night long. When it gets light, the escaping prisoners meet five soldiers. Among them is a major who recognizes the hunter. The major brings the hunter and his fellow travelers safely to Aschaffenburg, where the count resides.
On the same day, the hunter, the goldsmith and the count travel to his castle, where the countess is waiting for good news from her rescuer. Accordingly, she is delighted when she sees the goldsmith. She asks him to let her keep her clothes and her sack, with which she had disguised herself in order not to be convicted by the robbers as the real Countess. He allows her to do so. However, he asks to be allowed to keep the jewelry of his godmother, whom he has never seen before. He wants to give it to her personally on his way. The countess looks at the jewelry and is very surprised when she recognizes it. They are the gems that she herself sent to her godson, who is a goldsmith and who was supposed to work them for her. Therefore, before her stands none other than her godson, who saved her life.
The Countess takes her godson into the family in gratitude. When he returns from his wanderings, she sets up a complete house for him in Nuremberg.","Two young robbers are wandering through the forest.

The prince and his servant reluctantly entered the witch's house, but before they went to bed, the maiden warned the prince and his servant not to eat or drink anything the witch gave them because it might be poisonous. The next morning, the witch gave the prince's servant a poisonous drink, telling him to give it to his master, but the servant ended up spilling it on the prince's horse, killing it.
When he told the prince what had happened and they came to the dead horse, a raven was already eating the corpse. Deciding they may not find better food that day, the servant killed the bird and took it with him. Next, they reached an inn and the servant gave the innkeeper the raven to make food of it.

1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4,8,"A father had two sons. The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","An old king has a daughter, the world's finest daughter, to marry.

After waking up the next morning and saying his prayers, he found the shoes completely finished and perfectly well-made in his workbench. A customer soon entered the store and offered more than the usual price, for he was fond of the pair. One evening, shortly before Christmas, the shoemaker said to his wife, ""Why don't we stay up tonight and see who is giving us this helping hand,"" and his wife agreed. Hiding in a corner of the room, they saw two little men working quickly and nimbly on the shoes, then running away after their work was completely finished.

The next morning, his wife said, ""The little men have made us wealthy. We must show them our thanks. They are running around with nothing on, freezing.""

Second tale
A poor hardworking servant girl was sweeping out the house and shaking the sweepings onto a large pile when she found a letter on the pile.

Then, she says to herself, ""How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony."" Sometime later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth.A year later, Snow White's father, the king, marries again. His new wife is a very beautiful, but also vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that response because the magic mirror never lies. But when Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White learns of her stepmother's evil plan she tearfully begs the huntsman, ""Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!"" After seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of an animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once again: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,228.0,4,8,"A father had two sons. The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","There were two brothers, one of whom had a bad neck, the other a bald head. The oldest had a board before his head, but the youngest did not learn it. His father, Matthew, wanted to do it, but he did not know it. He told him that if he had done it, he would tell his father that he must do it to the oldest. The other, the hanging, would have ruined everything, cut off the vinegar and wine bottle, or died forever. Matthew, however, did not do it because he was afraid of his own nature. He got a goose's skin, and complained that it was too much for him. His brother, who is known as Hanging, said that he would learn it if he could only learn it from him. The father and brother laughed, and the brother complained. Hanging went, he had money, and if one had any money, he should not have to gruel him. He heard a man behind him saying that hanging could learn it, so he went upstairs to a castle full of gallows, where a dog had a tongue hanging out of his mouth. He went to the inn, where hanging was set on fire. The innkeeper told Hanging that he could learn the goose by giving him all his money. He asked Hanging what he could do if he did, and he did so, and hanging told him to do the same. He did it, and hunging followed him into the innkeeper's house. He was told by a fox that he was still alive, and that he had to give him all the money he could get from hanging. Then hanging went to his father, who told him he can learn it by the same means he could, and asked hanging if he was alive. He followed him over to the other side of the castle, and when he had the money, hanging did so again. He said hanging would do it as well as he wished, but hunging did not understand it. hanging said, ""I know what you can do, if you could learn this way, if I had your own life."" hanging then hung onto a table and threw himself into the fire.",hDE-EN,0.3903654485049834,0.1495016611295681,0.5247291,0.51401985,0.51931924,-3.7166826725006095,0.5637703672950186,-0.44689524,228-4,0.317287534455496,0.969023048877716,0.3099959201659,0.4099877107401646,0.3933224123111204,4.0

During this hike, one evening he and a circular smith accompanying him stop at an inn, where he meets a student and a wagoner. This inn is located in the Spessart region, which is notorious for robberies. The four men decide not to go to bed in order to avoid being robbed. In order not to be overcome by sleep, they tell each other four fairy tales. Around 10:00 p.m. a countess comes to the inn together with her huntsman and her lady-in-waiting. The men inform the huntsman of the impending danger. Therefore, the countess goes to a room with her lady and the hunter joins the men to have better chances of defense in case of an attack.
After midnight, the robbers do indeed arrive. However, they are only after the countess. The robbers want to kidnap her so that her husband will have to ransom her. The young goldsmith, who is small and has no beard, lets himself be ""kidnapped"" instead of her, disguised as the countess. The hunter and the student get themselves captured with the goldsmith and accompany him.
While the countess goes back home unharmed and the carter continues on his way, the three prisoners are taken to the campsite of the band of robbers. After they have held out there for five days, the robber chief comes to them and explains how serious the situation is. The count does not pay the ransom, so the captain is forced to inflict pain on the supposed countess. However, it seems impossible for the robber captain to put the countess in danger, as he respects her very much. Therefore, he proposes to the prisoners to escape together with them as soon as it gets dark. So the goldsmith, the huntsman, the student and the captain wander all night long. When it gets light, the escaping prisoners meet five soldiers. Among them is a major who recognizes the hunter. The major brings the hunter and his fellow travelers safely to Aschaffenburg, where the count resides.
On the same day, the hunter, the goldsmith and the count travel to his castle, where the countess is waiting for good news from her rescuer. Accordingly, she is delighted when she sees the goldsmith. She asks him to let her keep her clothes and her sack, with which she had disguised herself in order not to be convicted by the robbers as the real Countess. He allows her to do so. However, he asks to be allowed to keep the jewelry of his godmother, whom he has never seen before. He wants to give it to her personally on his way. The countess looks at the jewelry and is very surprised when she recognizes it. They are the gems that she herself sent to her godson, who is a goldsmith and who was supposed to work them for her. Therefore, before her stands none other than her godson, who saved her life.
The Countess takes her godson into the family in gratitude. When he returns from his wanderings, she sets up a complete house for him in Nuremberg.","Two young stag-maker and a gold-worker travel through the forest for the first time since the dawn of the twelve-year-old age.

They think it could be a robber's house, but it is a man who has murdered them in the sleep. One night, a man dressed as a guard carries a bottle of wine in front of his head. The man who carries the bottle is a goldsmith, but the man who does not know how to steal it is called Felix. Felix, the goldworker, is appalled by the way the men are traveling, and the man, who has a horse in his ear, only kills him because he is playing cards with them. When they come to the house, the man tells them that they are going to be robbed of their houses under the ground, and this house is called the Wirtshaus, which they have been told by a man at the front of a forest. When the man's room is opened, they hear horses, horses and horsemen, but if they don't kill them, they are only robbing the poor people of their towns.

She gave the man a drink, and the bird's heart came up. The daughter swallowed it herself. Then the witch told her that she had to steal the wishing cloak as well, and how to do it.

The old woman there warned him that it is a den of robbers, but he stayed, and when the robbers arrived, he persuaded them to take him on as a servant.
They set him to prove himself by stealing an ox that a man brought to market to sell.  He took a shoe with a silver buckle and left it in the road.  The man saw it and thought it would be good if only he had the other, and went on.  The son took the shoe and ran through the countryside, to leave it in the road again. The man left his ox and went back to find the other, and the son drove the ox off.
The man went back to get the second ox to sell it, and the robbers told the son that if he stole that one as well, they would take him into the band.  The son hanged himself up along the way, and when the man passed, ran on and hanged himself again, and then a third time, until the man was half-convinced that it was witchcraft and went back to see if the first two bodies were still hanging, and the son drove off his ox.
The man went for his third and last ox, and the robbers said that they would make him the band's leader if he stole it.  The son made a sound like an ox bellowing in the woods, and the man, thinking it was his stolen oxen, ran off, leaving the third behind, and the son stole that one as well.
The robbers were not pleased with his leading the band, and so they all left him.  The son drove the oxen out, so they returned to their owner, took all the treasure in the house, and returned to his father.
He decided to marry the daughter of a local squire and sent his father to ask for her hand, telling him to tell the squire that he was a Master Thief.  The squire agreed, if the son could steal the roast from the spit on Sunday.  The son caught three hares and released them near the squire's kitchen, and the people there, thinking it was one hare, went out to catch it, and the son got in and stole the roast.

The priest made fun of him, and when the Master Thief came to claim his reward, the squire asked him to prove his skill further, by playing some trick on the priest. The Master Thief dressed up as an angel and convinced the priest that he was come to take him to heaven.  He dragged the priest over stones and thorns and threw him into the goose-house, telling him it was purgatory, and then stole all his treasure.
The squire was pleased, but still put off the Master Thief, telling him to steal twelve horses from his stable, with twelve grooms in their saddles.  The Master Thief prepared and disguised himself as an old woman to take shelter in the stable, and when the night grew cold, drank brandy against it.  The grooms demanded some, and he gave them a drugged drink, putting them to sleep, and stole the horses.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal a horse while he was riding it.  The Master Thief said he could, and disguised himself as an old man with a cask of mead, and put his finger in the hole, in place of the tap.  The squire rode up and asked him if he would look in the woods, to be sure that the Master Thief did not lurk there.  The Master Thief said that he could not, because he had to keep the mead from spilling, and the squire took his place and lent him his horse to look.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal the sheet off his bed and his wife's shift. The Master Thief made up a dummy like a man and put it at the window, and the squire shot at it.  The Master Thief let it drop.  Fearing talk, the squire went to bury it, and the Master Thief, pretending to be the squire, got the sheet and the shift on the pretext they were needed to clean the blood up.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep.

After having given up, he sits awaiting his demise when he overhears a goose complaining about a ring stuck in her throat. The servant leaps up, grabs the goose and hurries to the kitchen, where the cook slits the goose's neck and reveals the missing gold ring. The King apologizes and offers the servant land and riches. The servant declines, accepting only a little gold and a horse on which to see the world.
On his journey to another town in another kingdom, the servant first encounters a number of animals in distress, including three fish out of water, ants at risk of being trodden upon, and starving raven fledglings in a nest. In each case the servant heeds the call for help, and in each case the grateful animals respond with ""I will remember and return the favour"".
In the next town, the servant learns that the King has announced that he wishes to marry off his daughter, but any suitor must agree to complete an arduous task to the end or be put to death. After one glimpse of the beautiful girl, the young man agrees. The King tosses a golden ring into the sea and tells the young man to retrieve it. He also adds that the young man must either bring the ring back, drown while getting the ring, or be drowned upon returning without it. However, the three fish appear, carrying a mussel with the King's ring inside.
Astonished, the King agrees to the marriage of his daughter to the servant. However, the princess sets him upon another task of refilling sacks of grain that she has spilled in the grass, because she has found out that he is not a noble and thus not her social equal. The young man is discouraged because he believes it impossible to gather all of the grain from the ground, and he lies down and falls asleep. When he wakes, he is surprised to find all the sacks are now refilled, with not one grain missing. The ant king had all of the ants working the entire night to fill them.
Still not satisfied, the princess sends the servant off on to bring her an apple from the Tree of Life. The servant does not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he sets off anyway. After a long journey, he encounters the three raven fledglings, who have flown to the end of the world, where the Tree stands, and retrieved the apple for him. The servant takes the apple to the princess and shares it with her, and the two are happily married.","A hidden bowl is used to eat alone every day. One of the servants is asked what can be found in the bowl. One day, a white snake cuts itself off and eats it, but the snake does not touch his lips. He hears the birds singing in front of the window. The servant is punished for the robbery. The snake comes to the king's court and asks for a ring. He takes the ring and brings it to the cook. The cook takes the enemy's tail and cuts off her neck. He tells the servant that he wants a honorary place in his court, but he wants only a horse and money in the world. On the second day, he comes to a pond with three fish in it. He goes to the forest, where the ravens have their sons. The sons are lying on the ground, claiming their wings to be hungry. He has his sons, but they are not able to find anything. He is taken out by the king, who wants to be his son.

They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.

The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a ""dirty little Cinderella"" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it.

First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","Two brothers, the oldest and the youngest, have a board in front of their head.

During this hike, one evening he and a circular smith accompanying him stop at an inn, where he meets a student and a wagoner. This inn is located in the Spessart region, which is notorious for robberies. The four men decide not to go to bed in order to avoid being robbed. In order not to be overcome by sleep, they tell each other four fairy tales. Around 10:00 p.m. a countess comes to the inn together with her huntsman and her lady-in-waiting. The men inform the huntsman of the impending danger. Therefore, the countess goes to a room with her lady and the hunter joins the men to have better chances of defense in case of an attack.
After midnight, the robbers do indeed arrive. However, they are only after the countess. The robbers want to kidnap her so that her husband will have to ransom her. The young goldsmith, who is small and has no beard, lets himself be ""kidnapped"" instead of her, disguised as the countess. The hunter and the student get themselves captured with the goldsmith and accompany him.
While the countess goes back home unharmed and the carter continues on his way, the three prisoners are taken to the campsite of the band of robbers. After they have held out there for five days, the robber chief comes to them and explains how serious the situation is. The count does not pay the ransom, so the captain is forced to inflict pain on the supposed countess. However, it seems impossible for the robber captain to put the countess in danger, as he respects her very much. Therefore, he proposes to the prisoners to escape together with them as soon as it gets dark. So the goldsmith, the huntsman, the student and the captain wander all night long. When it gets light, the escaping prisoners meet five soldiers. Among them is a major who recognizes the hunter. The major brings the hunter and his fellow travelers safely to Aschaffenburg, where the count resides.
On the same day, the hunter, the goldsmith and the count travel to his castle, where the countess is waiting for good news from her rescuer. Accordingly, she is delighted when she sees the goldsmith. She asks him to let her keep her clothes and her sack, with which she had disguised herself in order not to be convicted by the robbers as the real Countess. He allows her to do so. However, he asks to be allowed to keep the jewelry of his godmother, whom he has never seen before. He wants to give it to her personally on his way. The countess looks at the jewelry and is very surprised when she recognizes it. They are the gems that she herself sent to her godson, who is a goldsmith and who was supposed to work them for her. Therefore, before her stands none other than her godson, who saved her life.

When they do not return, their father thinks that they have gone off to play and curses them and so they turn into ravens.
When the sister is grown, she sets out in search of her brothers. She attempts to get help first from the sun, which is too hot, then the moon, which craves human flesh, and then the morning star. The star helps her by giving her a chicken bone (in the German) or a bat's foot (in the Greek) and tells her she will need it to save her brothers. She finds them on the Glass Mountain. In the Greek version, she opens it with the bat's foot, in the German, she has lost the bone, and chops off a finger to use as a key, (or she opens it with chicken bone). She goes into the mountain, where a dwarf tells her that her brothers will return. She takes some of their food and drink and leaves in the last cup a ring from home.
When her brothers return, she hides. They turn back into human form and ask who has been at their food.

2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3,8,"A father had two sons. The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","An old king had a daughter who was the prettiest princess in the world. He promised to watch the king for three nights. One night, he bites a carving bench with a knife, another a fire, and so on. At midnight, a raven begins to grow stronger and stronger, and a leg falls down a stone. The raven cries loudly, and the legs fall down. He sets them on the bench and turns them around. He throws them into a pond opposite the castle. Two black cats roar about the pond, saying, ""Ah! meow! what frightens us! what makes us frighten!"" and ""You fools, why don't you sit on the fire and warm yourself up?"". When the cats warm up, they say, ""Cammrad! we want to play one in the card."" He shows them his legs, cuts off the nails first. He grabs them and kills them. Then he puts them in a little pond. The pond is filled with black dogs, and soon the dogs are no longer able to find each other. He goes back to sleep. The next day, he goes to sleep in the hollow bed.

Shortly afterwards the servant is accused of stealing the Queen's ring. He is given one day to prove his innocence or submit to punishment. After having given up, he sits awaiting his demise when he overhears a goose complaining about a ring stuck in her throat. The servant leaps up, grabs the goose and hurries to the kitchen, where the cook slits the goose's neck and reveals the missing gold ring. The King apologizes and offers the servant land and riches. The servant declines, accepting only a little gold and a horse on which to see the world.

However, the princess sets him upon another task of refilling sacks of grain that she has spilled in the grass, because she has found out that he is not a noble and thus not her social equal.

They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters.

His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a ""dirty little Cinderella"" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it.

A customer soon entered the store and offered more than the usual price, for he was fond of the pair. One evening, shortly before Christmas, the shoemaker said to his wife, ""Why don't we stay up tonight and see who is giving us this helping hand,"" and his wife agreed. Hiding in a corner of the room, they saw two little men working quickly and nimbly on the shoes, then running away after their work was completely finished.

The next morning, his wife said, ""The little men have made us wealthy. We must show them our thanks. They are running around with nothing on, freezing."" She proposed to make clothes, and the shoemaker agreed to make a pair of shoes for each of them. The two of them did not stop until they had finished the work, then hid themselves again.

Second tale
A poor hardworking servant girl was sweeping out the house and shaking the sweepings onto a large pile when she found a letter on the pile.

The girl hesitated at first, but her master finally convinced her to accept.

Then the servant girl was led by the elves to their hollow mountain, where everything was smaller but also more splendidly ornamented.

The elves did everything to make her happy during those three days, but the girl again asked to leave. The little men gave her gold and let her leave their mountain.

Then, she says to herself, ""How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony."" Sometime later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth.A year later, Snow White's father, the king, marries again. His new wife is a very beautiful, but also vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that response because the magic mirror never lies. But when Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White learns of her stepmother's evil plan she tearfully begs the huntsman, ""Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!"" After seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of an animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once again: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

In the original Grimm version of the story, the frog's spell was broken when the princess threw the frog against the wall, at which he transformed back into a prince, while in modern versions the transformation is triggered by the princess kissing the frog.In other early versions, it was sufficient for the frog to spend the night on the princess' pillow.The frog prince also has a loyal servant named Henry (or Harry) who had three iron bands affixed around his heart to prevent it from breaking in his sadness when his master got under a spell. When the frog prince reverts to his human form, Henry's overwhelming happiness causes all three bands to break, freeing his heart from its bonds.","A king has three daughters.

The second sister is curious about it, and when she does it again, it's so cloudy that she does not want to drink it. But the  Frog is on the edge again and says that it would be for her.

The Frog, however, jumps again, and the second sister does not think about it and lays down happily in her bed. As she is lying there a while, she hears something crumbling at the door, and she sings: ""Oh, there is my treasure, that frog, said the princessess, now that I have promised it to him, I will give it up,"" so she stands up and opens the door to her.

During this hike, one evening he and a circular smith accompanying him stop at an inn, where he meets a student and a wagoner. This inn is located in the Spessart region, which is notorious for robberies. The four men decide not to go to bed in order to avoid being robbed. In order not to be overcome by sleep, they tell each other four fairy tales. Around 10:00 p.m. a countess comes to the inn together with her huntsman and her lady-in-waiting. The men inform the huntsman of the impending danger. Therefore, the countess goes to a room with her lady and the hunter joins the men to have better chances of defense in case of an attack.
After midnight, the robbers do indeed arrive. However, they are only after the countess. The robbers want to kidnap her so that her husband will have to ransom her. The young goldsmith, who is small and has no beard, lets himself be ""kidnapped"" instead of her, disguised as the countess. The hunter and the student get themselves captured with the goldsmith and accompany him.
While the countess goes back home unharmed and the carter continues on his way, the three prisoners are taken to the campsite of the band of robbers. After they have held out there for five days, the robber chief comes to them and explains how serious the situation is. The count does not pay the ransom, so the captain is forced to inflict pain on the supposed countess.

The son caught three hares and released them near the squire's kitchen, and the people there, thinking it was one hare, went out to catch it, and the son got in and stole the roast.

The priest made fun of him, and when the Master Thief came to claim his reward, the squire asked him to prove his skill further, by playing some trick on the priest. The Master Thief dressed up as an angel and convinced the priest that he was come to take him to heaven.  He dragged the priest over stones and thorns and threw him into the goose-house, telling him it was purgatory, and then stole all his treasure.
The squire was pleased, but still put off the Master Thief, telling him to steal twelve horses from his stable, with twelve grooms in their saddles.  The Master Thief prepared and disguised himself as an old woman to take shelter in the stable, and when the night grew cold, drank brandy against it.  The grooms demanded some, and he gave them a drugged drink, putting them to sleep, and stole the horses.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal a horse while he was riding it.  The Master Thief said he could, and disguised himself as an old man with a cask of mead, and put his finger in the hole, in place of the tap.  The squire rode up and asked him if he would look in the woods, to be sure that the Master Thief did not lurk there.  The Master Thief said that he could not, because he had to keep the mead from spilling, and the squire took his place and lent him his horse to look.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal the sheet off his bed and his wife's shift. The Master Thief made up a dummy like a man and put it at the window, and the squire shot at it.  The Master Thief let it drop.  Fearing talk, the squire went to bury it, and the Master Thief, pretending to be the squire, got the sheet and the shift on the pretext they were needed to clean the blood up.
The squire decided that he was too afraid of what the thief would steal next, and let him marry his daughter.","An old man and his wife want to rest from their work. A richly dressed gentleman comes to them in a four-wheeler carriage. One of them wants to be a master thief, but the other wants to serve him in a country dish. The one in the saddle, who is a count and a prince, does not want to be swallowed by the others, but is allowed to wash and roast potatoes and make them into cakes. The lazy one gets married with the servant's daughter, but if he does not do so, the ravens will be his music. The old man takes a young beech and ties it to the rope. The next morning, the scribe tells him the story of the stolen horse. He rides out into the castle with a pair of straw-rope ropes. The scribe asks for a glass of wine, the old man answers, ""Hear, hear, listen, listen to hear, to hear"" and the next morning he rides home. The innkeeper tells the innkeeper that he has a son who has gone to the world for a long time. He is an ugly young man, wise and cunning, and if he fails to learn anything, nothing will help him at all. At last, he runs away. When night falls, he comes to the village church with a young bush, a bundle under his arm, and a lantern. In the sack he has cloven hooves, and in the bundle he fastens the trunk with straw seeds. When the keeper is awake, he pulls out the trunk of the tree, which he has stolen from the inn. When he returns home, he finds himself in the inn with a bag of candy and a bottle of wine. He goes to the inn and finds a bag full of bottles and candy in the corners of the house. He takes them out of the inn, and they are to be found in the morning. When they arrive at the inn the next day, he is surprised to find that they have been robbed. He tells them that he is a robber, and that the robber is a murderer.

The boys decide to steal the moon and take it back to their country. There they also hang it on an oak tree and demand an appropriate fee from the community. As the boys grow old and realize that they will soon die, they decide one by one that each of them would like to take a quarter of the moon to his grave. In this way, the moon reaches the underworld, where its unfamiliar light awakens the dead. These become active again and begin to amuse themselves loudly.

The fourth brings a cart with horses and climbs up the tree, carries a hole in the Moon, cuts through a rope, and lets it down.

When they do not return, their father thinks that they have gone off to play and curses them and so they turn into ravens.
When the sister is grown, she sets out in search of her brothers. She attempts to get help first from the sun, which is too hot, then the moon, which craves human flesh, and then the morning star. The star helps her by giving her a chicken bone (in the German) or a bat's foot (in the Greek) and tells her she will need it to save her brothers. She finds them on the Glass Mountain. In the Greek version, she opens it with the bat's foot, in the German, she has lost the bone, and chops off a finger to use as a key, (or she opens it with chicken bone). She goes into the mountain, where a dwarf tells her that her brothers will return. She takes some of their food and drink and leaves in the last cup a ring from home.

2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1,8,"A father had two sons. The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","An old king had a daughter who was the most beautiful in the world.

He set fire to it, sets it on fire, and, at midnight, a raven begins to grow stronger and stronger. He grabs them on the raven bench and kills them. Then he puts them in a pond opposite the castle. As soon as he gets up, many black cats come to him. He gets up to sleep in the pond, and the cats go to sleep on the pillow. He goes to the fire and warms himself up. The cats are frightened, and he breaks his legs and puts the legs on fire. At midnight he hears a sound that starts to go off. He takes them to his bed and sleeps there.

Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a ""dirty little Cinderella"" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the stepmother and the two limping sisters horror, their merely servant-girl had win without any subterfuge. Both the parents and the two sisters would have killed Aschenputtel, but the prince put her before him on his horse and rode off to the palace.

When she comes home from the wedding, the eldest sister tells her sisters that the princess is the one who wants to be buried in the ground. The second sisters tell her that she has to go to the palace to get a coat of arms. The third sisters ask her to get the coats of arms, but she does not get them.

One day, the Bird has a chat with some other birds. They make fun of the Bird, saying that it was doing all the work and that he was like a slave. The next day, the Bird suggests that they switch roles and refuses to go to the forest. The Mouse and the Sausage oppose the idea at first, but in the end, they give in. The Bird now is responsible for bringing home the water, the Mouse cooks, and the Sausage goes to the forest to collect wood.
The Sausage leaves to gather wood in the forest early in the morning but does not come home again. The Bird gets worried and starts looking for it. Soon, it finds a dog, who has attacked and eaten the Sausage. The Bird lodges a complaint against the dog, but the dog lies and says that the Sausage was carrying forged letters, and therefore it needed to be punished with its life. The Bird cannot argue, so it goes home and tells the Mouse what has happened. They decide that they will have to do their best themselves from now on.
The Mouse starts to cook. It imitates the Sausage, rolling himself in the pot to mix and season the food. However, the Mouse cannot stand the heat and burns to death. The Bird comes home from the forest. It panics as it cannot find the Mouse and starts throwing the wood around the house. It yells and searches, but suddenly the wood catches fire.

The roast remains at the harbor until it is cooked, then it is grinded, salted and prepared. When he comes home, they sit at the table and, having eaten, sleep their skins until the next morning, and that is a marvelous life. On the other day, they do not want to go into the woods because they are old enough, and because they must change and try something else. And because the mouse beats hard for it, also the broth is mastered, so they have to take the courage to play by the way and come to the loos on the breadcrumb that the wood must carry, the mouse cooks, and the birds must fetch water. What happened? The broth moves on to wood, the Bird sets fire, the Mouse sets the pot on fire, and waits alone until it has broth and wood for the next day. However, it remains so far away that nothing good happens to them, and when it is time to eat, it is chopped and prepared four times by the brush or the mouse.

Hiding in a corner of the room, they saw two little men working quickly and nimbly on the shoes, then running away after their work was completely finished.

The next morning, his wife said, ""The little men have made us wealthy. We must show them our thanks. They are running around with nothing on, freezing."" She proposed to make clothes, and the shoemaker agreed to make a pair of shoes for each of them. The two of them did not stop until they had finished the work, then hid themselves again.

His new wife is a very beautiful, but also vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that response because the magic mirror never lies. But when Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White learns of her stepmother's evil plan she tearfully begs the huntsman, ""Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!"" After seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of an animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once again: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

Furthermore, if he swallowed the heart of the dead bird, he would find a gold coin by his pillow every morning.
He went out into the world and came to a castle where an old witch lived with her beautiful daughter. The witch knew about the bird's heart and told her daughter what she must do to steal it. She gave the man a drink, and the bird's heart came up. The daughter swallowed it herself. Then the witch told her that she had to steal the wishing cloak as well, and how to do it. The daughter looked at the Garnet Mountain and told the huntsman that she wished she were there. He took her under the cloak and wished them both there. He slept there and she stole the cloak and wished herself back home.
Three giants saw him and talked of killing him, but the third said that a cloud would carry him away. He climbed up the mountain and rode off on a cloud. It took him to a cabbage/lettuce garden. He was so hungry that he ate some, and it turned him into a donkey. He went on and found a different patch of cabbage/lettuce which turned him back into a man. He took both kinds of vegetables and went back to the castle. He told the witch that he was a royal messenger sent to fetch the finest vegetables for the king, but he was afraid that the heat would make it wither. The witch asked for some. He gave it to her and she, her maidservant, and the daughter all ate the cooked vegetables and became donkeys. The huntsman sold them to a miller, telling him to give the old one (the witch) one meal a day and three beatings, the younger one (the maidservant) three meals and two beatings, and the youngest (the witch's daughter) three meals and one beating.
After a time, he came back to the miller to see how the donkeys were doing. The miller told him that the oldest donkey was dead, but the two younger donkeys were so sad he thought they would die. The huntsman bought them back and turned them back into women. The witch's daughter told him where the cloak was and said she would give him back the heart as it had been stolen, but he said it would make no difference, if they wed, so they married shortly afterwards.","A hunter finds himself in a forest, where an old and ugly hunter's mother gives him food and shelter. He finds the hunter a gift: nine birds feed him a mantle. The hunter shoots down the mantle in the middle, but one of the birds kills him. When he returns to the forest and finds everything in it, he wants to get back to his human form. His mother tells him that he has lost his fortune and wants to see if he is still hungry. He goes to a mill, where he finds an almosen in a cup and gives it to his hunter-gatherer. His hunter is so angry that he sends him to the castle to look for the most delicious salad in the world. He wants to take it with him, but it is a wish coat that he can only wish for one place. The old hunter puts it under his pillow and tells her that he will not eat it if she dies. When she wakes up, he notices that the old mantle has died and that the other two have died. He asks her to take him back, but she does not give him back. He tells his mother that he is so tired that he must go to a mountain to get some food. She takes him back to her castle and asks for a hive, but he refuses. She asks him what he wants. He says that he wants the best salad for her. She gives him to a hunter in the mountain, and he goes to the mountain to eat it. He is so happy that he lets the bird eat it, but when he gets up he thinks it will be good for him. Then he goes back to the country, where his mother has forgiven him for eating it. In the mountain he meets a group of birds, and they eat him. He thinks he is the one with whom he has been at war, and when he is awake, he hears the voice of his mother saying that he was so tired he must eat it again.

The youngest went into a great woods, and a storm struck, so he sought shelter in a house.  The old woman there warned him that it is a den of robbers, but he stayed, and when the robbers arrived, he persuaded them to take him on as a servant.
They set him to prove himself by stealing an ox that a man brought to market to sell.  He took a shoe with a silver buckle and left it in the road.  The man saw it and thought it would be good if only he had the other, and went on.  The son took the shoe and ran through the countryside, to leave it in the road again. The man left his ox and went back to find the other, and the son drove the ox off.
The man went back to get the second ox to sell it, and the robbers told the son that if he stole that one as well, they would take him into the band.  The son hanged himself up along the way, and when the man passed, ran on and hanged himself again, and then a third time, until the man was half-convinced that it was witchcraft and went back to see if the first two bodies were still hanging, and the son drove off his ox.
The man went for his third and last ox, and the robbers said that they would make him the band's leader if he stole it.  The son made a sound like an ox bellowing in the woods, and the man, thinking it was his stolen oxen, ran off, leaving the third behind, and the son stole that one as well.
The robbers were not pleased with his leading the band, and so they all left him.  The son drove the oxen out, so they returned to their owner, took all the treasure in the house, and returned to his father.
He decided to marry the daughter of a local squire and sent his father to ask for her hand, telling him to tell the squire that he was a Master Thief.  The squire agreed, if the son could steal the roast from the spit on Sunday.  The son caught three hares and released them near the squire's kitchen, and the people there, thinking it was one hare, went out to catch it, and the son got in and stole the roast.

The priest made fun of him, and when the Master Thief came to claim his reward, the squire asked him to prove his skill further, by playing some trick on the priest. The Master Thief dressed up as an angel and convinced the priest that he was come to take him to heaven.  He dragged the priest over stones and thorns and threw him into the goose-house, telling him it was purgatory, and then stole all his treasure.
The squire was pleased, but still put off the Master Thief, telling him to steal twelve horses from his stable, with twelve grooms in their saddles.  The Master Thief prepared and disguised himself as an old woman to take shelter in the stable, and when the night grew cold, drank brandy against it.  The grooms demanded some, and he gave them a drugged drink, putting them to sleep, and stole the horses.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal a horse while he was riding it.  The Master Thief said he could, and disguised himself as an old man with a cask of mead, and put his finger in the hole, in place of the tap.  The squire rode up and asked him if he would look in the woods, to be sure that the Master Thief did not lurk there.  The Master Thief said that he could not, because he had to keep the mead from spilling, and the squire took his place and lent him his horse to look.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal the sheet off his bed and his wife's shift. The Master Thief made up a dummy like a man and put it at the window, and the squire shot at it.  The Master Thief let it drop.  Fearing talk, the squire went to bury it, and the Master Thief, pretending to be the squire, got the sheet and the shift on the pretext they were needed to clean the blood up.
The squire decided that he was too afraid of what the thief would steal next, and let him marry his daughter.","An old man and his wife want to rest from their work.

The boys decide to steal the moon and take it back to their country. There they also hang it on an oak tree and demand an appropriate fee from the community. As the boys grow old and realize that they will soon die, they decide one by one that each of them would like to take a quarter of the moon to his grave.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep.

Astonished, the King agrees to the marriage of his daughter to the servant. However, the princess sets him upon another task of refilling sacks of grain that she has spilled in the grass, because she has found out that he is not a noble and thus not her social equal. The young man is discouraged because he believes it impossible to gather all of the grain from the ground, and he lies down and falls asleep. When he wakes, he is surprised to find all the sacks are now refilled, with not one grain missing. The ant king had all of the ants working the entire night to fill them.
Still not satisfied, the princess sends the servant off on to bring her an apple from the Tree of Life. The servant does not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he sets off anyway. After a long journey, he encounters the three raven fledglings, who have flown to the end of the world, where the Tree stands, and retrieved the apple for him. The servant takes the apple to the princess and shares it with her, and the two are happily married.","A hidden bowl is placed on the king's table every afternoon, and no one in the kingdom knows what it is. One of the servants, curious about what is in the bowl, lets ten baskets of deer into the grass, which he has to read before dawn. When he discovers it, a white snake lies in it. He cuts off the basket and eats it. When the snake bites off his lips, he wants to take an apple from the tree of life, but the king has threatened to punish him if he does not steal it in the morning. The servant goes down to the royal courtyard. The deer are sitting there, and when he sees the deer, he hears a saying: ""I've eaten a ring that the queen has lost."" He takes it and carries it to the cook, who cuts it off. The cook, however, does not want to be allowed to eat it anymore, so he asks for a horse and money in the world. On the same day, he goes to a pond, where three fish are trapped in the pipe, and the king orders him to be punished if he doesn't steal the ring by the next day. The raven, whom he fed with his horse, brings the apple to the king, and he becomes the king of the country.",hDE-EN,0.4285714285714285,0.1778975741239892,0.5908384,0.5439433,0.56642187,-3.587541103363037,0.5691375531115178,-0.4116911,17-2,3.156717538636323,0.9676939249038696,0.3432207185355658,0.4896430384272587,0.4652393184453098,5.0

The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.

The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a ""dirty little Cinderella"" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the stepmother and the two limping sisters horror, their merely servant-girl had win without any subterfuge. Both the parents and the two sisters would have killed Aschenputtel, but the prince put her before him on his horse and rode off to the palace.

The oldest sister is allowed to go and read the books in the ashes of the mother's tomb. When she returns home from the wedding, she is given the name Ashenputtel. The sisters are also allowed to read her books, but she is forbidden to do so because she is afraid of being married to the prince, who is not supposed to be the prince at all. The daughter is also forbidden from reading the books, because the prince does not have the right to read them, and so the sisters refuse to read all the books. The two sisters agree to the name, but they do not agree to it.

Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

The princess thinks of a child who will be as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as this frame. She gives birth to a princess' daughter, who is called Snow White. When the princess is seven years old, the apple tree grows from her neck and she becomes the most beautiful woman in the country. She wants to marry a dwarf, but the dwarfs do not want to let her. The dwarf asks her for a mirror, which tells her who she is and how she got into her house. She tells the mirror that Snow White is still alive, but she is not allowed to eat it. Snow White goes to the castle, where she is dressed as an old princess, who does not know what she is supposed to eat. She is told that she is the prettiest princess of the country, and that she will not let anyone else eat Snow White's flesh. She goes to her castle and finds Snow White lying in her bed. When Snow White comes to see Snow White, she thinks she is one of the best princess in the world. She asks a huntsman to cut Snow White off her flesh and bring Snow White over the seven mountains. One of the huntsmen gets Snow White into the cave, and Snow White in the cave. She says Snow White will be killed if Snow White dies, but Snow White can't be seen or eaten. When snow falls down, Snow White falls to the ground. The huntman takes Snow White out of the cave and asks for the mirror to show Snow White who is the best woman, but snow falls to her head and she cannot be seen. She does not want Snow White to be seen, so Snow White takes her to the forest, where Snow White sits down and sleeps there. She has to wait until Snow White returns to her forest.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","Two brothers have a board in front of their heads.

During this hike, one evening he and a circular smith accompanying him stop at an inn, where he meets a student and a wagoner. This inn is located in the Spessart region, which is notorious for robberies. The four men decide not to go to bed in order to avoid being robbed. In order not to be overcome by sleep, they tell each other four fairy tales. Around 10:00 p.m. a countess comes to the inn together with her huntsman and her lady-in-waiting. The men inform the huntsman of the impending danger. Therefore, the countess goes to a room with her lady and the hunter joins the men to have better chances of defense in case of an attack.
After midnight, the robbers do indeed arrive. However, they are only after the countess. The robbers want to kidnap her so that her husband will have to ransom her. The young goldsmith, who is small and has no beard, lets himself be ""kidnapped"" instead of her, disguised as the countess. The hunter and the student get themselves captured with the goldsmith and accompany him.
While the countess goes back home unharmed and the carter continues on his way, the three prisoners are taken to the campsite of the band of robbers. After they have held out there for five days, the robber chief comes to them and explains how serious the situation is. The count does not pay the ransom, so the captain is forced to inflict pain on the supposed countess. However, it seems impossible for the robber captain to put the countess in danger, as he respects her very much. Therefore, he proposes to the prisoners to escape together with them as soon as it gets dark. So the goldsmith, the huntsman, the student and the captain wander all night long. When it gets light, the escaping prisoners meet five soldiers. Among them is a major who recognizes the hunter. The major brings the hunter and his fellow travelers safely to Aschaffenburg, where the count resides.
On the same day, the hunter, the goldsmith and the count travel to his castle, where the countess is waiting for good news from her rescuer. Accordingly, she is delighted when she sees the goldsmith. She asks him to let her keep her clothes and her sack, with which she had disguised herself in order not to be convicted by the robbers as the real Countess. He allows her to do so. However, he asks to be allowed to keep the jewelry of his godmother, whom he has never seen before. He wants to give it to her personally on his way. The countess looks at the jewelry and is very surprised when she recognizes it. They are the gems that she herself sent to her godson, who is a goldsmith and who was supposed to work them for her. Therefore, before her stands none other than her godson, who saved her life.
The Countess takes her godson into the family in gratitude. When he returns from his wanderings, she sets up a complete house for him in Nuremberg.","Two gold miners, one eighteen years old, and one sixteen-year-old, travel through the forest. They meet a man who tells them a good story. He tells the story to them, but they don't understand it. The gold miner, Felix, is afraid that he will become a master of the craftsmen. When he meets a magician, he asks why he is not allowed to play cards, since he is supposed to be a robber's house. The magician explains that the robbers do not want to be robbed, but that they want to get away with it. When the magician is awake at night, he hears a rustling sound and asks if he should be allowed to go to the goldsmith's lodging. Felix, who is also a goldsmith, says that he is afraid of being robbed. When they come to the lodging, Felix tells that he has been robbed by a band of thieves in the woods. Felix is also afraid that they will not be able to find him. He asks whether he is allowed to stay in the house until nightfall. When night falls, Felix and his band of friends leave the house, but Felix is unable to find his way. Felix's band breaks down, and Felix is forced to leave. The musician tells him that the musicians have been robbing the house for the rest of the night. He has to go through the house in order to get to the house.

In a dark forest, they came to a small house, where a maiden warned them that her stepmother was a witch who disliked strangers, but unfortunately there was nowhere else for shelter.  The prince and his servant reluctantly entered the witch's house, but before they went to bed, the maiden warned the prince and his servant not to eat or drink anything the witch gave them because it might be poisonous. The next morning, the witch gave the prince's servant a poisonous drink, telling him to give it to his master, but the servant ended up spilling it on the prince's horse, killing it.

As the boys grow old and realize that they will soon die, they decide one by one that each of them would like to take a quarter of the moon to his grave. In this way, the moon reaches the underworld, where its unfamiliar light awakens the dead. These become active again and begin to amuse themselves loudly. When St. Peter becomes aware of this noise, he calls together the heavenly hosts, believing that the dead are attacking.
Since there is no attack, St. Peter personally goes to the underworld, calms the dead and takes the moon to heaven, where he hangs it up.","A country where the night is always dark and the sky is turned like a black cloth.

When they do not return, their father thinks that they have gone off to play and curses them and so they turn into ravens.
When the sister is grown, she sets out in search of her brothers. She attempts to get help first from the sun, which is too hot, then the moon, which craves human flesh, and then the morning star. The star helps her by giving her a chicken bone (in the German) or a bat's foot (in the Greek) and tells her she will need it to save her brothers. She finds them on the Glass Mountain. In the Greek version, she opens it with the bat's foot, in the German, she has lost the bone, and chops off a finger to use as a key, (or she opens it with chicken bone). She goes into the mountain, where a dwarf tells her that her brothers will return. She takes some of their food and drink and leaves in the last cup a ring from home.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","Once upon a time, an old king had a daughter who was the most beautiful maiden in the world.

Shortly afterwards the servant is accused of stealing the Queen's ring. He is given one day to prove his innocence or submit to punishment. After having given up, he sits awaiting his demise when he overhears a goose complaining about a ring stuck in her throat. The servant leaps up, grabs the goose and hurries to the kitchen, where the cook slits the goose's neck and reveals the missing gold ring. The King apologizes and offers the servant land and riches.

The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear.

Then, she says to herself, ""How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony."" Sometime later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth.A year later, Snow White's father, the king, marries again. His new wife is a very beautiful, but also vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that response because the magic mirror never lies. But when Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White learns of her stepmother's evil plan she tearfully begs the huntsman, ""Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!"" After seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of an animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once again: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

One wise cat suggested they wait until the wolf had caught new prey and then approach him as if they wanted to eat the leftovers. The cat would then attack the wolf's eyes, and the others would join in to overpower him. The plan worked, and the wolf died. Vogel Holgott tells his mate this story to emphasize the importance of loyal friendship. However, Vogel Mosam, who had become friends with the couple, began to think only of his own survival and plotted to get rid of the old male bird.

4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,228.0,chatGPT_e2e,8,"A father had two sons. The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","Once upon a time, there were two brothers, one of whom was clever and capable, while the other was foolish and had a board in front of his head.

One day, the younger brother wanted to learn how to be scared, and the neighbor offered to teach him in his spooky schoolhouse. The younger brother ended up pushing a ghost down the stairs and was kicked out of his father's house. He set out to learn how to be scared and encountered various spooky creatures, but he was not scared of them.

2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,231.0,chatGPT_e2e,8,"The novella Das Wirtshaus im Spessart, written by Wilhelm Hauff in 1826, deals with the robber theme and tells the story of the journeyman hike of the goldsmith Felix.
During this hike, one evening he and a circular smith accompanying him stop at an inn, where he meets a student and a wagoner. This inn is located in the Spessart region, which is notorious for robberies. The four men decide not to go to bed in order to avoid being robbed. In order not to be overcome by sleep, they tell each other four fairy tales. Around 10:00 p.m. a countess comes to the inn together with her huntsman and her lady-in-waiting. The men inform the huntsman of the impending danger. Therefore, the countess goes to a room with her lady and the hunter joins the men to have better chances of defense in case of an attack.
After midnight, the robbers do indeed arrive. However, they are only after the countess. The robbers want to kidnap her so that her husband will have to ransom her. The young goldsmith, who is small and has no beard, lets himself be ""kidnapped"" instead of her, disguised as the countess. The hunter and the student get themselves captured with the goldsmith and accompany him.
While the countess goes back home unharmed and the carter continues on his way, the three prisoners are taken to the campsite of the band of robbers. After they have held out there for five days, the robber chief comes to them and explains how serious the situation is. The count does not pay the ransom, so the captain is forced to inflict pain on the supposed countess. However, it seems impossible for the robber captain to put the countess in danger, as he respects her very much. Therefore, he proposes to the prisoners to escape together with them as soon as it gets dark. So the goldsmith, the huntsman, the student and the captain wander all night long. When it gets light, the escaping prisoners meet five soldiers. Among them is a major who recognizes the hunter. The major brings the hunter and his fellow travelers safely to Aschaffenburg, where the count resides.
On the same day, the hunter, the goldsmith and the count travel to his castle, where the countess is waiting for good news from her rescuer. Accordingly, she is delighted when she sees the goldsmith. She asks him to let her keep her clothes and her sack, with which she had disguised herself in order not to be convicted by the robbers as the real Countess. He allows her to do so. However, he asks to be allowed to keep the jewelry of his godmother, whom he has never seen before. He wants to give it to her personally on his way. The countess looks at the jewelry and is very surprised when she recognizes it. They are the gems that she herself sent to her godson, who is a goldsmith and who was supposed to work them for her. Therefore, before her stands none other than her godson, who saved her life.
The Countess takes her godson into the family in gratitude. When he returns from his wanderings, she sets up a complete house for him in Nuremberg.","sehr unterhaltsam sind.

In a dark forest, they came to a small house, where a maiden warned them that her stepmother was a witch who disliked strangers, but unfortunately there was nowhere else for shelter.  The prince and his servant reluctantly entered the witch's house, but before they went to bed, the maiden warned the prince and his servant not to eat or drink anything the witch gave them because it might be poisonous. The next morning, the witch gave the prince's servant a poisonous drink, telling him to give it to his master, but the servant ended up spilling it on the prince's horse, killing it.
When he told the prince what had happened and they came to the dead horse, a raven was already eating the corpse. Deciding they may not find better food that day, the servant killed the bird and took it with him. Next, they reached an inn and the servant gave the innkeeper the raven to make food of it. Unknown to the prince and his servant, the inn was really a robbers' den. The robbers returned, and, before killing the travellers, sat down to eat. Immediately after eating a few bites of the raven soup the innkeeper had prepared, the robbers fell down dead from the poison that the raven had in its body.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons.

Then, she says to herself, ""How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony."" Sometime later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth.A year later, Snow White's father, the king, marries again. His new wife is a very beautiful, but also vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that response because the magic mirror never lies. But when Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White learns of her stepmother's evil plan she tearfully begs the huntsman, ""Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!"" After seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of an animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once again: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","The bed shook and a voice cried out, ""I'm freezing, I'm freezing!"" Hänschen replied, ""Then warm yourself by the fire!"" But the bed shook even more violently and the voice called out even louder, ""I'm freezing, I'm freezing!"" Finally, Hänschen couldn't take it anymore and jumped out of bed. There he saw a naked man shivering from the cold. Hänschen brought him to the fire and asked him who he was. The man replied that he was a poor sinner who was being held captive in the castle. Hänschen asked him why he was naked, and the man replied that he had lost all his clothes when he tried to escape from the castle. Hänschen took pity on him and gave him his coat, and they sat together by the fire and talked until Hänschen fell asleep. The next morning, Hänschen woke up alone and the man was gone.

During this hike, one evening he and a circular smith accompanying him stop at an inn, where he meets a student and a wagoner. This inn is located in the Spessart region, which is notorious for robberies. The four men decide not to go to bed in order to avoid being robbed. In order not to be overcome by sleep, they tell each other four fairy tales. Around 10:00 p.m. a countess comes to the inn together with her huntsman and her lady-in-waiting. The men inform the huntsman of the impending danger. Therefore, the countess goes to a room with her lady and the hunter joins the men to have better chances of defense in case of an attack.
After midnight, the robbers do indeed arrive. However, they are only after the countess. The robbers want to kidnap her so that her husband will have to ransom her. The young goldsmith, who is small and has no beard, lets himself be ""kidnapped"" instead of her, disguised as the countess. The hunter and the student get themselves captured with the goldsmith and accompany him.
While the countess goes back home unharmed and the carter continues on his way, the three prisoners are taken to the campsite of the band of robbers. After they have held out there for five days, the robber chief comes to them and explains how serious the situation is. The count does not pay the ransom, so the captain is forced to inflict pain on the supposed countess. However, it seems impossible for the robber captain to put the countess in danger, as he respects her very much. Therefore, he proposes to the prisoners to escape together with them as soon as it gets dark. So the goldsmith, the huntsman, the student and the captain wander all night long. When it gets light, the escaping prisoners meet five soldiers. Among them is a major who recognizes the hunter. The major brings the hunter and his fellow travelers safely to Aschaffenburg, where the count resides.
On the same day, the hunter, the goldsmith and the count travel to his castle, where the countess is waiting for good news from her rescuer. Accordingly, she is delighted when she sees the goldsmith. She asks him to let her keep her clothes and her sack, with which she had disguised herself in order not to be convicted by the robbers as the real Countess. He allows her to do so. However, he asks to be allowed to keep the jewelry of his godmother, whom he has never seen before. He wants to give it to her personally on his way. The countess looks at the jewelry and is very surprised when she recognizes it. They are the gems that she herself sent to her godson, who is a goldsmith and who was supposed to work them for her. Therefore, before her stands none other than her godson, who saved her life.
The Countess takes her godson into the family in gratitude. When he returns from his wanderings, she sets up a complete house for him in Nuremberg.","Two young men, a compass maker and a goldsmith, are walking through the forest at night.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.

Sometime later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth.A year later, Snow White's father, the king, marries again. His new wife is a very beautiful, but also vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that response because the magic mirror never lies. But when Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her.

After seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of an animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder.

The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle.

The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.

The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead.

The story is about two brothers who have very different attitudes towards money.
Bruder Sparer is a frugal and cautious man who saves every penny he earns. Bruder Vertuer, on the other hand, is a spendthrift who lives extravagantly and indulges in every pleasure he can afford.
One day, the two brothers set out on a journey together. Along the way, they come across a man who is starving and asks for their help. Bruder Sparer is hesitant to give the man any money, as he is afraid that it will compromise their own finances. Bruder Vertuer, however, is quick to give the man all the money he has on him.
As they continue on their journey, Bruder Sparer's caution proves to be useful, as he is able to save them from several dangerous situations. Bruder Vertuer's recklessness, however, often lands them in trouble.
Eventually, the two brothers come across a treasure, and they must decide how to divide it. Bruder Sparer suggests that they save most of it and only use a small portion for their immediate needs. Bruder Vertuer, however, insists that they spend all of it and indulge in every luxury they desire.
In the end, Bruder Sparer's caution and frugality prove to be the wiser choice, as they are able to save the treasure and live comfortably for the rest of their lives. Bruder Vertuer, on the other hand, squanders his share of the treasure and is left with nothing.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","""Das Gruseln"" is a German folktale written by Ludwig Bechstein.

He prepares it for dinner, but when he cuts into it, he finds that the cabbage is filled with stones and dirt.
The farmer realizes that he has been cruel to his donkey and feels guilty. He sets out to find the donkey and apologize. When he finds the donkey, he asks for forgiveness and promises to treat him better. The donkey forgives the farmer and turns back into his original form.

They set him to prove himself by stealing an ox that a man brought to market to sell.  He took a shoe with a silver buckle and left it in the road.  The man saw it and thought it would be good if only he had the other, and went on.  The son took the shoe and ran through the countryside, to leave it in the road again. The man left his ox and went back to find the other, and the son drove the ox off.
The man went back to get the second ox to sell it, and the robbers told the son that if he stole that one as well, they would take him into the band.  The son hanged himself up along the way, and when the man passed, ran on and hanged himself again, and then a third time, until the man was half-convinced that it was witchcraft and went back to see if the first two bodies were still hanging, and the son drove off his ox.
The man went for his third and last ox, and the robbers said that they would make him the band's leader if he stole it.  The son made a sound like an ox bellowing in the woods, and the man, thinking it was his stolen oxen, ran off, leaving the third behind, and the son stole that one as well.

The squire was pleased, but still put off the Master Thief, telling him to steal twelve horses from his stable, with twelve grooms in their saddles.  The Master Thief prepared and disguised himself as an old woman to take shelter in the stable, and when the night grew cold, drank brandy against it.  The grooms demanded some, and he gave them a drugged drink, putting them to sleep, and stole the horses.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal a horse while he was riding it.  The Master Thief said he could, and disguised himself as an old man with a cask of mead, and put his finger in the hole, in place of the tap.  The squire rode up and asked him if he would look in the woods, to be sure that the Master Thief did not lurk there.  The Master Thief said that he could not, because he had to keep the mead from spilling, and the squire took his place and lent him his horse to look.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal the sheet off his bed and his wife's shift. The Master Thief made up a dummy like a man and put it at the window, and the squire shot at it.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","There was once a old king who had a daughter who was the most beautiful Virgin in the world.

So he stood before the king and offered himself to watch for three nights in the castle. “So I ask for a snorkeling bank with the snorkeling knife, a snorkeling bank and a fire.” All of this will be brought into the old closet. The way it begins to become dark, he goes into himself. At first, everything is quiet in it, he makes his fire, puts the knit bank next to it with the knife and sits on the rotating bank. But as it is about midnight, a rumor begins, first done, then stronger, bif! More and more angry, then a little bit is quiet, finally a foot comes down the stone and stands right in front of him. “Heda, calls the bourgeois, even more, one is too little. Then the noise comes from fresh, then another leg falls down and another one and so on until it is nine. “Now it’s enough and they’re good for the kick, but the balls are still missing, fresh!” It is terrible and two heads fall down. He puts it in the row and turns it around: “You’re throwing well!” Then he makes his legs straight and puts them up like the kegel: “Heida! We want to play one in the card.” “Yes,” he answered, “but once show your feet, you have so long nails that I will first cut off.” Thus he packed them on the neck and raised them to the knit bank, and then he stretched them and smashed them deadly. Then he brought them out and throwed them into a small tail, in front of the lock. As he brought them to rest and wanted to sit back to the fire and warm up, there came many black cats and dogs, soon from all corners and more and more, that he could no longer climb, that they screamed, came to him on his fire, broke it, and made it completely out. Then he took his knife and said, “From your puppy!” and went into. One large thil was running away, the other he killed and brought it out into the thil. Then he turned the fire out of a rainbow and heated himself. When he had warmed himself, he stood and lay in a large bed standing in the corner. And when he just wanted to fall asleep, the bed began to drive and walked around the whole slot. Then the bed, like six horses, was running over thresholds and stairs: hop! He threw it down to the top and he down. Then he swallowed roofs and pants into the hill and went out, “May you drive, who has desire!” and lay to the fire and slept until the day was.

He went down, took them out of the tube and brought them into the water; the fish cried: “We want to remember it and reward it for you.” He continued, and soon he heard a monkey king calling: “Go on with your great beast, which breaks with its wide feet all of us together.” He looked to the earth, and his horse had fallen into a monkey hole. He drove it down, and the monkey king called after him: “We want to remember it and reward it for you.” Then he came into a forest, and the rabbits threw their sons out of the nest, and they were big enough, they said, and they could feed themselves. The boys were on the ground and cried, they had to die from hunger, their wings would be too small, they could not yet fly and look for something. And he went down from the horse, and took his bag, and cast it dead, and threw the young rabbs, who soon came, and were tired, and said, “We want to remember it and reward it for you.” He went on and came into a great city, where it was announced that whoever wants to have the prince cessin, whoever should do what they will give up to him, if he is not able, he has lost his life. But many princes had already been there, and they were all killed, so that no one would dare to do so anymore. The princess made it known again. The young man thought he wished to do so and declared himself free. Then he was brought out to the sea, and a ring was thrown down, which he would repeat, and if he came out of the water without the ring, he would fall into it again, and he would die in it. But as he stood on the shore, the fish he had thrown out of the tube came into the water, and the middle had a mushle in his mouth, and the ring was in it, and the mushle he placed on his feet on the beach. Then the young man was happy, brought the ring to the king and asked the princess. But the princess, when she heard that there was no prince, did not want him, and she threw ten sacks of sheep into the grass, which he must read first, that no corn is missing before the morning sun rises. And the monkey king came with all the monkeys that the young man had guarded, and read all the monkeys in the night, and brought him into the bags, and before the sun rises they were ready. As the princess saw it, she was surprised, and the young man was brought before her, and because he was beautiful, he liked her, but she asked for the third, he should make her an apple from the tree of life. When he stood and thought about how he could do that, one of the rabbits he fed with his horse came and brought the apple into the snab.

She calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.

The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a ""dirty little Cinderella"" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the stepmother and the two limping sisters horror, their merely servant-girl had win without any subterfuge. Both the parents and the two sisters would have killed Aschenputtel, but the prince put her before him on his horse and rode off to the palace. While passing the hazel tree the two magic doves from heaven declare Aschenputtel as the true bride of the prince, and remained on her shoulders, one on the left and the other on the right.","There was once a rich man who lived fun for a long time with his wife, and they had a single daughter together. The snow covered a white rubber on the mother's grave, and when the sun had pulled it away again, and the tree was green for the second time, then the man took another woman. But the mother had two daughters, from her first husband, who were beautiful in face, but proud in heart, hopeful and evil. As the wedding was, and all three came into the house, the poor child was in a bad time. “What does the gorgeous uselessness in the stoves,” said the stone mother, continuing with her to the kitchen, if she wants to eat Brod, she must first have earned, she can be our magd.” Then the sisters took his clothes away, and took a old gray rock to him: “It’s good for you,” they said, laughed out and brought it to the kitchen. Then the poor child had to do such a hard work: to get up early before the day, to carry water, to make fire, to cook and to wash, and the sisters to throw him all the broken heart, to shoot it, to throw him herbs and lenses into the ash, and then he had to sit all day and read it again. At one time the king appointed a ball, which should last three days in all glory, and his son, the prince, should choose a companion; The two proud sisters were also invited. The next morning, the two sisters came to the kitchen, and when they saw that ash butter read the lenses, they were evil, because they wanted to shut it, and because they couldn’t, they wandered to tell about the ball and said, “Ash butter, that’s been a pleasure, in the dance, the prince, the most beautiful in the world, has led us to that, and one of us will be his companion.” “Yes,” said Aschenputtel, “I’ve seen the lights shine, that might have been pretty wonderful.” “Hey! – “I’ve stood up on the taubestone.” “When she heard this, the hatred pulled her down and ordered her that the taubestone should be destroyed. But the prince saw the car standing in front of the Thor, and thought a strange princess was going to attack. When the ash was home, it went back to the tree on the mother's grave: ""Bäumlein riddle you and riddle you! “Maybe it was the one who was driving in the magnificent car with the six raps?” said Aschenputtel. In front of the door was a car with six shadows, which had high white shadows on the head, and the servants were dressed in roth and gold. When the ashes came, the prince stood on the stairs and brought them into the hall. But the prince wanted to know who the strange princess was, where she came from and where she was going, and had placed people on the streets that should be careful about it, and so that she could not go so fast, he had left the stairs full of luck. But because he was struggled with sorrow, one of the golden shoes remained stuck, and in fear he did not think of taking him with him. But in the light he heard the one saying, “God knows who the desirable princess is, that she should be buried in the earth! “Listen,” said the mother secretly, “you have a knife, and if the shoe is too narrow to you, cut off a piece of your foot, it hurt a bit, but what hurt it, it will pass soon, and one of you will be a queen.” Then the oldest went into her room and tried the shoe, and the footstep came in, but the brush was too big, and she took the knife and cut herself a piece of the brush until she pushed the foot into the shoe. So she went out to the prince, and when he saw that she was holding the shoe, he said that the bride, led her to the car and wanted to go with her. Then she took the shoe into her room, and when the foot was too big, she got the teeth together and cut a large piece of the teeth away, and pressed the shoe quickly. But when he came to the Thor, the dolls called again: “Rucke di guck, Rucke di guck! Blood is in shock: the shock is too small, the right bride is still sitting at home. The prince looked down, and the white stripes of the bride were colored red and the blood was drawn up. Then the prince brought her back to the mother and said, “This is not the right bride. But there is no daughter in the house.” “No,” said the mother, “there’s only a thick ashes that is still there, which is sitting down in the ashes, which the shoe cannot fit. And if he fits you, you will be my companion.” Then he pulled the heavy shoe out of the left foot, put it on the golden shoe, and pressed a little, and it stood in it as if he was attached to him. And when it came up, the prince looked in his face, and he recognised the beautiful princess again and called, “This is the right bride.” The shepherd mother and the two proud sisters were scared and bleached, but the prince carried the ashes and raised it into the wagon, and when they drove through Thor, the dolls cried:",hDE-EN,0.5222611305652826,0.2071035517758879,0.5561601,0.5488869,0.55249953,-3.5972018241882324,0.5594568223959893,-0.7788498,21-German_25-False-False-False,0.1058992370896909,0.944667100906372,0.1895163095362352,0.4301279477273616,0.3900260080288406,12.0

The Bird cannot argue, so it goes home and tells the Mouse what has happened. They decide that they will have to do their best themselves from now on.
The Mouse starts to cook. It imitates the Sausage, rolling himself in the pot to mix and season the food. However, the Mouse cannot stand the heat and burns to death.

The girl helped with the baptism and asked to leave, but the elves convinced her to stay three days with them. The elves did everything to make her happy during those three days, but the girl again asked to leave. The little men gave her gold and let her leave their mountain. When she returned home, the servant girl learned that she did not spend three days with elves but seven years. Meanwhile, her former masters had died.


Third tale
A woman had her child taken from the cradle by elves and substituted with a changeling. Her neighbour advised her to set the changeling on the hearth, make a fire, and boil water in two eggshells: that should make the changeling laugh, and if he laughs it will be all over with him. The woman did everything her neighbour had said, and the changeling started to laugh about her cooking in shells. Then a band of little elves suddenly appeared, brought the rightful child, set it on the hearth, and took the changeling away.","and I. The shooter he made the work. A shooter was so poor that he had nothing more than the leather for a single pair of shoes. He cut them up in the evening, sits in bed and wants to take them to work the next morning. But as he has stood up and wants to sit at work, the two shoes are already ready and beautifully made on his table. Soon there came a buyer, who paid them so well that the shutter could buy leather for two pairs of shoes, which he cut again in the evening, and as he wanted to work them the next morning, they were just so well ready, and for the money he spent out of it, he could buy leather for four pairs of shoes, which were made there the third morning. As he wanted to go to bed a night shortly before Christmas, and had cut off a lot of things again, he said to his wife: “We want to stay and see who thut our work in the night.” So they stumbled a light, hidden in the stains behind the clothes that were hanged there, and gave eight. At midnight, two small, cute, naked men came, sitting on the work table, taking all the appropriate work before themselves, and working so incredibly fast and careful that the shooter could not remove their eyes from them before wondering.

She fills her pockets with peas and lentils and marks the trail with them as she follows the ashes.
They lead her to a dark and silent house. A bird in a cage calls out ""Turn back, turn back, thou bonnie bride, Nor in this house of death abide."" An old woman in a cellar kitchen tells her that the people there will kill and eat her unless the old woman protects her and hides her behind a cask. A band of robbers arrives with a young woman whom they kill and prepare to eat. When one chops off a finger to get at the golden ring on it, the finger and ring fly through the air and land in the lap of the hiding woman.

If this was their concern, the prince said, he wanted to help, and to bind a bond to each tree, so that it could not miss the way. For a while, she tried to postpon it, as if it had hidden her, but finally all excuses came out, and she had to go on a day. From morning to evening she went through a long, long forest, and finally came in front of a large house, everything was quiet in it, just a old woman sat in front of the door. “Can they not tell me if the prince lives here with my bride?” — Well, my child, the woman answered, “You come now, because the prince is not home.” I have to bring water into a large box, they want to kill you, cook and eat.

The brethren took the old grandmother, killed them, and pulled her all the rings from the fingers, one after another, but the ring from the gold finger, which did not want to go down, then one hit a foot and lifted the finger, but the finger jumped back and just fell into the princess' shoot. After the Spitzbubbs long forgottenly searched around the finger, one finally started to say: Have you searched for a big foot? “Let’s let the search be at light,” another said, “ tomorrow morning we’re going to search, then we’ll have the ring soon.” After that, the grandchildren lay down in the same celler to sleep, and as they slept and swallowed, the bride went out to the back of the foot, and they all stood in a row, and she had to go away over all the sleeping, to the door.

Then, she says to herself, ""How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony."" Sometime later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth.A year later, Snow White's father, the king, marries again. His new wife is a very beautiful, but also vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that response because the magic mirror never lies. But when Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White learns of her stepmother's evil plan she tearfully begs the huntsman, ""Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!"" After seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of an animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once again: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

Franz Jüttner's illustrations from Sneewittchen (1905)","It was once in the middle of the winter, and the snow flocks fell like feathers from the sky, then a beautiful queen sat on a window that had a frame of black edge wood, and wet. And as she looked and looked after the snow, she stumbled with the needle into the fingers, and three drops of blood fell into the snow. The Queen was the most beautiful in the whole country, and even proud of her beauty. She also had a mirror, before which she stood every morning and asked, “Mrs. Queen, you are the most beautiful woman in the country.” And she knew that no one was better in the world. But Snowwittchen grew up, and when he was seven years old, it was so beautiful that the queen itself was overwhelmed by beauty, and when she asked her mirror, “Mirror, mirror on the wall: “Who is the most beautiful woman in the whole country?” said the mirror. “Mrs. Queen, you are the most beautiful here, but Snewittchen is a thousand times more beautiful than you!” As the queen heard the mirror speak so, she was crazy of jealousy, and from hour to hour she hated the snowflower, and when she looked at it, and thought that by her fault she was no longer the most beautiful in the world, her heart turned around. Then the hatred did not leave her quiet, and she called a hunter and said to him, ""Let the snowflower go out into the forest in a wide remote place, where the stick dies, and bring me his lungs and his liver to the sight, which I will cook and eat with salt."" The hunter took the snowflake and brought it out, but as he had pulled the horsefighter and just wanted to go, then it began to cry, and asked so much, he could let his life, he never wanted to come back, but to continue in the forest. But Snowwittchen was alone in the great forest, so that he was very afraid, and began to walk and walk over the top stones, and through the dorns all day: finally, when the sun wanted to fall, it came to a small house. Then he tried the seven bedlins each other, but no one was right to him, except the seventh day, in which he lay and slept. The first said, “Who is sitting on my chair?” The second, “Who has eaten of my plate?” The third said, “Who took my bread?” The fourth said, “Who has eaten my vegetables?” The fifth asks, “Who has struck me?” The sixth said, “Who has cut my knife?” The seventh said, “Who has drank out of my cup?” Then the first looked around and said, “Who has come into my bed?” The second said, “Well, is there someone in me?” and so all went up until the seventh, as he saw after his bed, and he found the snowflower in it and slept. “Because no one, when the seven pigs were in the seven mountains, knew that it had been saved to them, and now again, see how she could kill it, for as long as the mirror did not say that she would be the most beautiful woman in the whole country, she had no rest. She knocked at the door and called, “stay up, stay up, I’m the old cremer who has good good goods wrong.” Snow White looked out of the window: “What do you have?” “Snürriemen, dear child,” said the old man, and brought out one that was flown of yellow, red and blue seed, “will you have it?” “Yes,” said Sneewittchen, and thought that the good old woman I might be able to put in, which meints straight. So the door climbed up and the snorkelers acted. Soon after that was the night, the seven dragons came to the house, which were scared when they found their dear snowflower lies on the earth, as if it was dead. “There was no one but the queen,” she said, “who wanted to take your life, take care of you, and let no one enter. But the queen stood in front of her mirror, and worshipped her from anger, saying, ""So shall the snowman still die, and if it costs my life."" Then she went into her most secret tabernacle, and no one was allowed to come before her, and there she made a toxic, toxic apple, outside it was beautiful and red-becked, and everyone who saw him was pleased to do it. Then she dressed herself as a farmer, went before the tiger house and knocked. But the queen rejoiced, went to the house and asked the mirror, “Mirror, mirror on the wall: “Who is the most beautiful woman in the world?” He answered, “Mrs. Queen, you are the most beautiful woman in the land.” “Now I’m calm,” she said, as I’m the most beautiful one in the country again, and this time Snow White will surely be dead.” The snorkeling came to the house in the evening from the mines, where the beloved Snow White was on the ground and was dead. Then they made a shark of glass, and put it in, so that it could be seen, and wrote on it with golden letters his name and his descent, and one stayed at the house every day and guarded it. Once a young prince came to the tiger house and wanted to stay in it, and when he came into the tabernacle and saw Snow White lies in the glassarg on which the Seven Light Lines throwed their shade so straight, he could not get tired of his beauty, and read the golden inscription and saw that it was a royal sister. Then he asked the cowgirl, that they should sell him the shark with the dead snorkel, but they did not want all gold. Then he asked them, they could give it to him, he could not live without seeing it, and he wanted to keep it as high and honor as his beloved in the world. Then the gentlemen were compassionate and gave him the sword, but the prince brought him into his castle, and put him in his tabernacle, and he himself sat with him all the day, and could not turn his eyes away. And when he had to go out, and could not see the Snow White, he was sad, and he could not even eat a bit when the Sarg wasn't standing next to him. But the servants, who had to constantly carry the shark, were evil about it, and one once made the shark up, lifted the snow wheels into the hill, and said, ""For such a death of ten girls, we will be plagued all day,"" and gave him a stump in his back with his hand. Then the thick apple grain, which it had broken out, took him out of his neck, and Snow White was alive again. Then it came to the prince, who didn’t know what he should do before joy, when his beloved Snow White was alive, and they sat together on the table and ate in joy. On the other day the wedding was ordered, and Sneewittchen's wicked mother was also invited. As she stood before the mirror in the morning and said, ""Lee burned, and she could not stop until she had danced to death.""",hDE-EN,0.4684989429175475,0.1919661733615222,0.5973491,0.60173804,0.5995356,-3.114060878753662,0.5600984069570459,-0.70211816,52-German_25-False-False-False,2.0194524127885467,0.9551510214805604,0.2394628932599077,0.513862899400448,0.4681295650436913,6.0

Look for an outcome elsewhere.” He opened his window and left the beloved God standing. So the beloved God turned his back, went over to the small house and knocked.

The prisoner immediately put his pipe and let the black man come and said to him: “See without fear, go calmly to the court and let everything happen, only take the blue light with you.” He was listening to it, and he told him that he should be hanged on the gall. As he was brought out, he asked the king for a grace. “I’m allowed to smoke a pipe on the way.” “You can smoke three if you want,” the king said. Then he pulled out his pipe and burned it on the blue flame, as soon as the black man came before him. “There all kill me,” said the soldier, and the king in three pieces.

Goldener could not understand the word of the bird maker, he went sad but comforted, back into the forest and again decided to look for the cottage of his father. “I just need such a bear!” and the door of the garden closed. Goldener liked it, because there was a very colorful life in the flowers, especially because he had abandoned the hope to find the house of his father. “Go to the forest!” said the gardener to the Goldener one morning, “Give me a wild rose, so that I can plant roses on it!” Goldener went and returned with a layer of the most beautiful gold-colored roses, which were not different as if they had wrapped the most intelligent gold shade for the table of a king. “Pack yourself with these golden roses!” The gardener cried, “You have to do with the evil,” and he throwed him out of the garden by putting the golden roses into the earth under many disgrace. He walked day and night, from tree to tree, from rocks to rocks. Goldener liked it, because a golden life was revealed to him in the waves, especially because he had completely abandoned the hope of finding his father's house. A hundred years ago, the old king, who had no inheritors, destroyed his crown into the sea, and so long as the fate of any happy person had determined to pull the crown out of the depth, the throne would be filled with sadness without a successor.” “Hello our king!” the fishermen called, and the Goldeners put the crown up. The client of the Goldener and the recovered royal crown soon entered the land from ship to ship and over the sea. Then the golden area was soon occupied by colourful nails and by ships that were drawn with flowers and labyrinths. They greeted all the ship on which King Goldener stood. He stood, the bright crown on the head, on the front of the ship, and looked quietly to the sun, as it disappeared in the sea.

But his mother hates her, takes her seven newborn children and puts down dogs for them. A servant is supposed to kill the children in the forest, but fails to do so and leaves them there. The beauty is buried up to her chest, gets only dog food, above her a washbasin, everyone dries their hands on her hair, for seven years. Once in the forest the knight sees the children with their gold chains. His mother is frightened, the servant has to look for them and have the chains melted down. The goldsmith succeeds only with one. Without the chains, the sons must remain swans. At the mountain lake, the knight lets them feed. Their sister begs and shares with their mother. They do not know each other, but resemble each other so much that the knight lets the child tell. His mother still tries to have it killed by the servant, is herself put into the hole, the swans redeemed, except for one, of which one finds ""in many a book much strange adventure described.""","In one land there was a young Knight who was rich and beautiful, and had a magnificent castle. At one time he ran with his dogs into the forest to hunt, and he saw a hindu (Hirschkuh), which was white than the snow, and fled up before him and from it to the mountains among the wild high rivers. Over it he came to a river where he saw a beautiful virgin standing, washing and wearing a curved chain in his hand. Then came the time that the young woman came into the child’s bed, and genas of six sons and one daughter, who had all the gold rings around their heels. Soon the old wicked woman, the mother of the young Lord, came, and took the seven children, while the mother was sleeping, and took them away, and placed seven young dogs, which were thrown in the same night, in their place. Now this false and unfaithful woman had a familiar servant, to whom she answered the seven children, and committed him with loyalty and jealousy to carry them into the wild forest, to kill them, and to be buried in the earth or to drown in the water. The servant promised to do this, brought the little girl into the forest, put her under a tree and prepared to burn her. But the Creator of all beings, who guides all things to the best, mercyed the little one and sent them a feeding father, which was an old wise master who lived in the valley to keep wisdom, who took the little one into his cage and fed them with the milk of the sheep cows who were used to come to him, for seven years. When that evil woman had taken the children away from her mother, she brought her son to the young woman, showed her the puppy and said, “Soon, the children that your wife had born to you are young dogs.” She did this for revenge to her son because he loved the young woman so much. When he saw this, he believed in his mother and hated the young woman, which he had so loved before, nor wanted to hear a word of apology, but he let her be buried in the ground on the courtyard before the palace of his castle to the chest, and on her head he put a washing bag with water, and ordered all of his sister to wash over her head and dry her hands on her beautiful hair. At home he told his mother and other gentlemen and friends that he saw small children in the forest with gold cakes on the holes. Then he commanded the servant to ride fast into the forest, to look for the children who have not died with them, and to take the golden chains from them, otherwise they would both be scattered. As the servant presented the chains of the elders, he sent them to a gold shade and called him to make a cup of the same. “When the gold shade sought to throw a cup of the chains, he found that the gold was noble and pure, that it could not be processed with the hammer or flushed in the fire, except on a chain, which he broke down and made a ring of it. The others he woke on his wage, put them side by side, and gave so much other gold to weight, and made a cup of it, and he gave it to the woman, and also the ring, which closed both in their box. They kept a large mirror-clear lake on which they lay down. Then they gave her the waste from the table, and she shared it with the poor woman in the grave, for whenever she saw it, she had to cry bitterly. But if you ask for the swords, these are my brothers who were fed with me from the milk of the Hindu women in the woods. And he took a white sword, and followed the little girl, when it came down to the swords according to his habit. Only the Lord guarded his, and came, and as the servant wanted to do the wrongdoing, he shot his sword out of his hand. Then the Knight came to his mother and forced her to confess with threats. Then she closed up her box and gave the son the cup that was to be made from the chains. As he was also concerned about the punishment, he knew the truth that he still had the whole chains, except one from which he made a ring. The Knight called him to bring the chains, and gave them to the Virgin. He put the swords, each one around the neck. Now the Knight even promptly took the poor woman out of the earth, and made her relaxed again with noble spices and precious warts, so that she became a beautiful woman again. He put his false mother into the hole, in which his innocent wife had been decorated for seven long years and suffered by that evilness.

The sniper praised the saved treasure, where the shooter said, “It will be a right bite that you saved.” Through it they reached a bridge that had beautiful, wide and smooth stones on their walls, and then the cutting man wanted to convince his brother that saving is a good thing, for the proverb says: Save in time, so you are in need, and: Young blood, save your good!

So bird Holgott tells his wife as an example of friendship to take bird Mosam to the rich fish lake. When food becomes scarce, Mosam lets her kill him.","“On the sea stand there was a lot of wolves, among them a lot of blood-dring, who at one time wanted to gain a special glory among his companions and went to a mountain where many and many animals stayed there to hunt. But this mountain was calmed, and the animals were safe from other animals and dwelled in unity with each other. Among them was also a shark of mouse dogs or cats who had a king. Now the wolf had come through the hole with a list, hidden and started a cat every day and ate it. That was very sorry for the cats, and they gathered for advice among their king; and there were in particular three wise, insightful cats, who called the king in his advice and asked the first about his vote against the harmful wolf. The first cat said: “I do not know any advice against this great misery, but to command us in God’s grace, for how do we want to resist the wolf? The king asked the second cat, and he said, “The I recommend that we leave this place together and look for another quieter place, as we have to stay here in great trouble, body and life danger. “And the third cat said to the king’s question: “The My advice is to stay here and not escape through the wolf. I also got a advice to overcome it. “Tell him,” the king commanded, and the cat continued to say, “We must be careful that when the wolf gets a new beat, and wherever he carries and eats it, then you, o king, and I, and our strongest, must approach him, as if we wanted to eat what he left, so he will consider himself completely safe and fear us nothing. Then I will jump on him and cut his eyes out, and then all the others must fall upon him, so that he can no longer resist us, and we must not be mistaken, that one or the other of us will hurt life or bear wounds from it. For by this we save ourselves and our children from the enemy, and a wise man does not divide himself from his father's heritage with fears and fears. No, he defends it with body and life danger. This council was called the king well. It happened that the wolf had done a good catch, and he threw it on a rock, and then the cats performed their work, which the courageous wise cat had committed. And the wolf had to shamefully end his life under their wrath and countless bites.” “This example,” continued Vogel Holgot, “I tell you, dear woman, so that you understand that faithful friendship is helpful, and that’s why I like to take Vogel Mosam with my friend and companions.” When she heard the woman, she rejoiced inherently that her attack went out so undisputedly and according to her heart’s desire. And then the three birds went up to that fun place; they left in the old nest the boys that had been burned back, and they built nests there, and they lived there peacefully and gently with rich food for a time with each other. And the bird of Holgotha, who became old and weak, and his wife had much better the bird of Mosam in their hearts than he will show them like. And it came a dirty hot time, and everything was dried, and the lake was dried, and the fish died. The bird Mosam said to himself, “It’s a good thing about faithful friendship, and it’s pleasant when friends keep together. But each one is the next one. Who is not useful to himself, how can the other be useful? Whoever does not predict future harm and avoids it, he will not escape it when he is there. Now I predict how the company of these birds will hurt and break me, as the food is reduced from day to day. And ultimately they will hunt me. But I like it here, and I could also live alone, without that society. And it would be good if I preached them and freed me from them, and first from the man, for the woman trusts me entirely, and then I force them unevenly easier. She can even help kill the man.” The With such angry and shameful thoughts, the bird of Mosam flew to the woman and approached her very sadly and shattered. The woman asked him, “Why do I see you so sad, my friend?” and he answered, “I’m sad about the hard time and I see terribly the passage of the hunger ghost. One thing only I know, which I have given you, if my advice does not ignore you.” “Who is this?” asked the woman, and Mosam said, “Friendship bonds are more valuable than blood-related bonds, because they are often more harmful than poison. A speech says: Whoever lacks a brother, has a fewer enemy; and whoever has no relatives, has no hatred. But it would be easy for me to suffer the death for your sake. Say that way! For whoever does not spend his life for a faithful friend, he is very foolish, for a friend is more useful as a brother or as children.” Now Moses spoke with Arglist: “My advice is that you seek to get rid of your old weak man and be alone, for whom you have to take care so hard. There will be happiness and healing for you, and I will be with you. And do not ask about the cause of this council until you have fulfilled it, for if I had no good reason to do so, believe me, I’t recommend that.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","There were once two brothers, of whom the one, the oldest, did not fall on the head, but was sturdy and pfiffy over all dimensions. But the younger had, as they say, a plate in front of his head. This greatly concerned the Father, but he did not, for he lived in the world without caution and without anger, as the fools live, and he liked, without knowing it, having the speech in his head: Do not learn too much, you have to do too much. If the Father wanted to have done something, he must always tell the elder, Matthew, for the other, who had done things wrongly, broke the oil crop and the burning bottle, or there was an eternity. “My school house is the most wicked nest of a house everywhere, I’m scared all day that it falls over my head and once the hopeful rings fall together.

Now it didn’t go well; The coastline prosecuted him with his father, and he became wild and cried: “The boy is a twelve-night man, let him go out of my eyes. “No, my good companion, frightening is much better learned when one is alone than when he is two. So he was found by the man with whom he went yesterday and who came today to get the money. That’s why he continued to desire to take nothing to the lock, but a good fire, a cutting bank and a rotating bank, “so it doesn’t cool me,” he said, “and I can waste my time.” “It was pleased to be given to the handman, and he set up his seat in a beautiful room with a large fire in the old closet. Then they bite after him, and he took his knife and scratched their heads, and throwed cat heads and bodies out of the window into the closet tombs. When he came back to the fire, a large dog sat there, whispered his teeth, and had a flame tongue to the neck. This didn’t like Hanzhen again, he took his knife again and thus raised the dog right between the teeth in the neck, then the tongue fell down and the upper head took goodbye to his subpart. The next morning the king stood at his bed and said, “Well, I will have a healthy sleep if I have it! Hanshen took the two halves, throwed them out of the stone into the stone, and brought his fire back in order. As he stood and looked around, one of the two half became a single man, but no more beautiful, who was sitting on the chair of Hanshen. “There was a variety of thieves there, they came down to the stone, and we walked with dead legs.” He looked at the king’s skin and said, “But this is terrible.” “What do you do, Lord King?” he asked. Suddenly, a great rumor emerged, six men entered the room, carrying a mortal load on the bar, put them in front of Hanchen and disappeared. “Oh, the cold, he’s very steady before the cold,” said Hansen, “I have to heat it!” he lifted the dead out of the shell and brought him to his fire, but he remained cold. “Well,” said Hanshen, “give it out, but until I have it, you’ll stay in the neck and wear the scroll on your shoulders.” The It was a very uncomfortable wear, the bank on the shoulders, and the bar into the wheel, which pulled. “I got a box full of gold, one for you and one for the poor. “You should still be angry,” said the young queen, Henzhen’s companion, and made a shell of water with little founder and Ellritz, and when Henzhen slept, she took his bed cover away, and shelled the shell full of water and fish over Henzhen. “Brrrr!” he got up and caught up from the cold.",hDE-EN,0.4996982498491249,0.1858780929390465,0.5035063,0.5169723,0.5101505,-3.652541160583496,0.5481186170292317,-0.50314176,228-German_25-False-False-False,0.4445896148459345,0.955466091632843,0.2836072631119337,0.3895021159426073,0.3718529738041616,4.0

During this hike, one evening he and a circular smith accompanying him stop at an inn, where he meets a student and a wagoner. This inn is located in the Spessart region, which is notorious for robberies. The four men decide not to go to bed in order to avoid being robbed. In order not to be overcome by sleep, they tell each other four fairy tales. Around 10:00 p.m. a countess comes to the inn together with her huntsman and her lady-in-waiting. The men inform the huntsman of the impending danger. Therefore, the countess goes to a room with her lady and the hunter joins the men to have better chances of defense in case of an attack.
After midnight, the robbers do indeed arrive. However, they are only after the countess. The robbers want to kidnap her so that her husband will have to ransom her. The young goldsmith, who is small and has no beard, lets himself be ""kidnapped"" instead of her, disguised as the countess. The hunter and the student get themselves captured with the goldsmith and accompany him.
While the countess goes back home unharmed and the carter continues on his way, the three prisoners are taken to the campsite of the band of robbers. After they have held out there for five days, the robber chief comes to them and explains how serious the situation is. The count does not pay the ransom, so the captain is forced to inflict pain on the supposed countess. However, it seems impossible for the robber captain to put the countess in danger, as he respects her very much. Therefore, he proposes to the prisoners to escape together with them as soon as it gets dark. So the goldsmith, the huntsman, the student and the captain wander all night long. When it gets light, the escaping prisoners meet five soldiers. Among them is a major who recognizes the hunter. The major brings the hunter and his fellow travelers safely to Aschaffenburg, where the count resides.
On the same day, the hunter, the goldsmith and the count travel to his castle, where the countess is waiting for good news from her rescuer. Accordingly, she is delighted when she sees the goldsmith. She asks him to let her keep her clothes and her sack, with which she had disguised herself in order not to be convicted by the robbers as the real Countess. He allows her to do so. However, he asks to be allowed to keep the jewelry of his godmother, whom he has never seen before. He wants to give it to her personally on his way. The countess looks at the jewelry and is very surprised when she recognizes it. They are the gems that she herself sent to her godson, who is a goldsmith and who was supposed to work them for her. Therefore, before her stands none other than her godson, who saved her life.
The Countess takes her godson into the family in gratitude. When he returns from his wanderings, she sets up a complete house for him in Nuremberg.","The Many years ago, when the roads were still bad and not as frequent as now, two young bourgeois moved through this forest. He was eighteen years old and was a circlesmith. The other, a gold worker, could have almost sixteen years of age after his appearance and was probably his first trip to the world. The evening had already come up, and the shadows of the enormous layers and boxes blurred the narrow path on which the two walked. When the wind went out through the trees, it was like he heard trees behind him. When the dust turned on the way and shared, he believed to see faces rolling behind the bushes. In Würzburg, where he had learned, among his comrades, he was considered an untouched bourgeois, whose heart was sitting on the right flank; But he was very courageous today. Often it was to him that he was followed by the circlesmith to go another station instead of staying at the entrance of the forest overnight. For example, because of my Sunday rocks that I have in the field, or because of the harvest of a speaker? There, you must be dressed in gold and silk, when they find it worth the effort to kill one.” “Stop it! But the young Goldschmidt said, you shouldn’t trust, maybe it could be a robbery. But the circlesmith taught him that the thieves had their houses or caves under the earth, and this must be the housing that a man described to them at the entrance of the forest. They could, when they stood on their teeth, ignore the stube. On the oven in a armchair was a man who was able to be a driver in his clothes and probably the master of the car in front of the door. On the other side of the offend, a woman and a girl were sitting and spanning; Behind the table on the wall was a man sitting, who, with a glass of wine in front of himself, had his head in his hands, so that they could not see his face. But the circlesmidt [118] wanted to notice from his clothes that he must be a predecessor. When they were still standing on the lawn, a dog hit in the house; Munter, the dog of the circle, answered, and a magd appeared in the door and looked out to the strangers. They were promised to give meals and beds. They entered and placed the heavy bonds, the stone and the hat in the corners, and sat to the Lord on the table. He turned up with her greeting, and they saw a fine young man who thanked them gently for her greeting. “The throw of a beautiful horse is music in the ears of this snake and draws it for an hour away. But if a few poor bears like us go through the forest, people to whom the thieves could rather give something themselves, then they will not raise up the foot.” “This is true,” said the driver, who, awakened by the arrival of the strangers, had also entered the table. “They can’t give a poor man much for his money, but there are examples that they’re deceiving poor people for murder or forcing them to fall under the band and serve as thieves.” “Now, if it looks like this with these people in the forest,” the young Goldschmidt noted, “so this house will really give us little protection. The man is rarely at home, [119] The They say they trade wine. But the woman is a quiet woman, who no one wants evil. “No, he is wrong with you, Lord.” “And yet,” the young man took the word, “but I don’t want to deny all that he said. Several of them had predicted that they would stay in this housing, and when after two or three weeks they did not hear anything of them, they searched their way, and they also asked here in the housing, there should no one be seen. It is suspicious.” “I know God,” the circle called, “there we acted more reasonably when we approached our night camp under the next best tree than here in these four walls, where there is no rise to think when they once occupied the door. For the windows are shattered.” The They were all thoughtful through these speeches. It did not seem unlikely that the gifts in the forest, whether forced or voluntarily, were in agreement with the thieves. The young lord wanted to trave on his red through a secure, open valley, the circlesmidt wanted to do twelve of his handful companions, armed with knots, as the body guard, Felix, the gold worker, was afraid, more about the jewelry of his goodwill than about his life; But the driver, who was just thinking about the smoke of his pipe, said quietly: “Your lords! Everything has to lie to me, or you are a student, a teacher.” “A teacher does not,” the young man smiled, “but a student and wants to travel home in the holidays; But what is in our books is less suitable for telling than what you have and belong there. That’s why you always wake up if otherwise you like to listen to them.” “Even higher than a card game,” the driver replied, “it applies to me when someone tells a beautiful story. Often I prefer to ride on the road in the worst step and listen to someone who goes next and tells something beautiful; I have taken some of them on the car in the bad weather, provided that he tells me something, and I have a friend of me, I think, just because he knows stories that last seven hours and longer.” “That’s what I’m doing,” the young gold worker added, “to count I like to hear for my life, and my master in [121] Würzburg had to ordinarily ban me the books, that I didn’t read too many stories and neglect the work about it. Don’t just give a nice price, circlesmidt, I know you could tell me from now until it’s the day before your stock goes out.” The The circlesmith drunk to strengthen himself to his lecture, and then hub to:",hDE-EN,0.3738317757009346,0.1532710280373831,0.50062126,0.5062554,0.5034225,-3.527861833572388,0.5400591161382831,-0.8750829,231-German_25-False-False-False,0.0,0.9538187384605408,0.1308800742582701,0.3411290208373118,0.3060875297408048,4.0

In a dark forest, they came to a small house, where a maiden warned them that her stepmother was a witch who disliked strangers, but unfortunately there was nowhere else for shelter.  The prince and his servant reluctantly entered the witch's house, but before they went to bed, the maiden warned the prince and his servant not to eat or drink anything the witch gave them because it might be poisonous. The next morning, the witch gave the prince's servant a poisonous drink, telling him to give it to his master, but the servant ended up spilling it on the prince's horse, killing it.
When he told the prince what had happened and they came to the dead horse, a raven was already eating the corpse. Deciding they may not find better food that day, the servant killed the bird and took it with him. Next, they reached an inn and the servant gave the innkeeper the raven to make food of it. Unknown to the prince and his servant, the inn was really a robbers' den. The robbers returned, and, before killing the travellers, sat down to eat. Immediately after eating a few bites of the raven soup the innkeeper had prepared, the robbers fell down dead from the poison that the raven had in its body. The innkeeper's daughter then showed the prince and his servant the robbers' hidden treasure, but the prince insisted that the daughter keep it.
Continuing on, the prince and his servant next came to a town where a princess would marry any man who asked her a riddle that she could not solve. If she could solve it, the man's head would be cut off. The prince asked the princess, ""What slew none, and yet slew twelve?"" The princess could not solve the riddle, so she sent her maid to see if the prince revealed the riddle while talking in his sleep. The prince was prepared, however, because that night he had his servant sleep in his bed. When the maid came in, the servant ripped off her robe and chased her out.  Next, the princess sent her chambermaid to spy on the prince while he was asleep, but the prince's servant also ripped off her robe and chased her out. On the third night, the prince slept in his own bed, and the princess herself came in. The prince pretended to be asleep and the princess asked him the answer to the riddle. After the prince revealed the answer, the princess departed, but left her robe behind.
The next morning, the princess announced the answer of the riddle: ""A raven ate from a dead, poisoned horse, and died from it. Then, twelve robbers ate the raven and died from that."" The prince declared that the princess had not solved the riddle herself, but rather questioned him in his sleep. The town judges asked for proof, and the prince showed them the three robes.

Four eyes, he thought, see more than two, we’re already going to beat ourselves, fresh courageous, is half won. But the Father and Mother, as they heard of it, were in great sadness, and because they believed that their beloved child should die there, they did not want to let him go and say: “It is better that he dies and be buried with us than in the stranger.” That’s why they drowned poison into the goodbye wine and said, “Dear son, drink for the last time with us,” but it was as if he noticed their intention, because he didn’t want to drink, but he climbed the horse and said, “Live well, dear parents, I have to go, eh another wins the beautiful Virgin.” Then they raised the glass to him, that he should drink with force, but he gave the horse the spores, that the wine sprinkled and sprinkled the horse into the ear. When they had run for a while, the horse fell away, and the Lord wanted to sit on the servant’s horse, and the servant had to walk behind the three and carry the bond on his back. Now the rabbits lay down on the dead horse and eat it, but because the flesh was poisoned, they will also be poisoned and soon die. Then the servant raised up three of the dead rabbits, and took them with him into the house of the residence, and thought that it should feed the spiders. And he gave them a little hack and baked three bread from it. The next morning they came through a forest in a thick cloud, where twelve spiders jumped and held the Lord and the servants. The servant said, “Let us live, we have no money, but three breads we will give you.” Those were satisfied, they took the bread, tile them among themselves, and ate them. Not long, she met the poison, and all the twelve fell dead to the earth. Now the two ran into the city, and the young merchant stood before the queen and said he wanted to give up her a puzzle. He said, “On one blow one, on two blow three, on three blow twelve: how is this to be solved?” The queen was astonished, but she couldn't bring out the mystery.

But the servant was wise, and had placed himself in the bed at the place of his Lord; and when the shepherd came, he took her the clothes that she was wearing, and hunted her with ruts. He put the clothes in his ranks. In the second night, the kings sent their Chamber Jews, but the servant took the clothes and continued to hunt them with roots. But in the third night the king's daughters came and had a cloudy gray dress and sat on the Lord's bed. And when she thought he was dreaming, she spoke to him and hoped that he would answer in the dream, but he was awake and understood and heard everything well.

The next morning she said, “I have saved the mystery,” and let the twelve judges come and solve it before them. But the young man asked to hear from them and said, ""If she had not come in the night and had asked me, she't know.""

Take the mantle with you, it’s a desire mantle, if you throw it around your shoulders, you just need to wish yourself in one place, thought, done and you’re there. But cut the dead bird up, and take out the heart, and drank it all, and then you will be able to lift all and every morning, when you rise, gold under your head, and this comes to you because of the heart of the bird.” The The hunter thanked the wise woman and thought to himself, “Beautiful things, even if all of them happen!” But as he had gone about a hundred steps, he heard a scream and a scream over himself in the West, that he looked up, and he saw a crowd of birds riding around, with their scratches and their feet, and crying, breaking, and swallowing, as if they wanted to have one alone. “Now,” said the hunter, “it’s wonderful, it’s come, as the mother said,” he took the boxes from the shoulder, placed it, and that his shoulder in the middle, that the flies flown around. Since the hunt had hunted the old like him, he cut the bird up, searched for the heart, swallowed it down, and took the mantle to the house. The next morning, when he woke up, the promise came to him and he wanted to see if the promise came to him. It came to pass that one day he came through a thick forest and, as it was over, there was a remarkable closure on a level before him. But the old man was a witch and said to the girl: “There comes a man from the forest, who has a wonderful treasure in the body, which we must praise for it, my heartbrother, that is better for us than it is for him,” and made a drink, and as it was cooked, that she put it in a cup and gave it to the girl, which had to reach it to the hunter. He said, “Now, my beloved, drink me.” Then he took the cup, and as he had swallowed the drink, he broke the heart of the bird out of the body. Only the birds that fly will come, a man no longer.” “This is all your sorrow,” said the Hunter, “I will soon take it from your heart.” He caught her under his mantle and desired to go over the granate mountain, and at the moment they both sat on it. As he was sleeping, he buried his mantle from his shoulders and put him around, read the grenades and the stones, and thus desired to go home. But when the hunter had dropped out of his sleep and woke up, he saw that his loved ones had betrayed him and left him alone on the wild mountain. Now the giants passed, and the first hit him with his foot, and said, “What is there for a rope and looks inside?” The second said, “Take him dead!” The third said, “This would be the effort worthy. Only let him live, he climbs up to the mountains, and the clouds take him and carry him.” During this conversation they passed, but the hunter had noticed their words, and as soon as they were gone, he stood up and climbed the mountain peak. Now the hunter sits down and sleeps out of his tiredness, and when he wakes up the next morning, he throws a head out of the evil and the good salad and thinks, “This will help me back to my own and punish the faithfulness.” Then he set his heads and climbed over the wall and went on to look for the end of his beloved. When he walked a few days, he was so happy to find it. When he was finished, she couldn't wait until it stood on the table, but she immediately took a few leaves and put them in the mouth; But they were hardly swallowed, so was also the human shape lost, and it went down as an eseline into the garden. The boat was sitting at the time with the beautiful girl, and when no one came with the salad, and it was also lust after it, he said: “I don’t know where the salad is.” Then the hunter thought, “It’s already given something,” and said, “I’m going to go to the kitchen once,” and as he came down, he saw the two elephants running around in the yard and the salad lies on the ground. “It’s right,” he said, “the two have their teel away!” and he lifted up the remaining leaves, put them on the shell and brought them to the girl. Now the hunter washed his face and went down into the garden, so that the transformers could recognize him and said, ""Today you will receive the reward for your untrue."" Then he binding them all three on a seal and pushed them forward until he came to a mould, and knocked the mould to the window. After a few days, the Müller came and said, “He had to report that the old Eselin, who had only been hit and had nothing to eat, would have died; And the other two, he continued, are not dead and get to eat, but they are so sad that it cannot last long with them.” Then the hunter mercyed, and let all the anger run, and said to the mullers that he should hurt them again. And when they came, he gave them to eat of the good salad, so that they became humans again. Your wish mantle is hanging in a closet and for the bird heart I want to take a breach drink.” Then he was in a different sense and said, “Let’s keep it, it’s just one, for I’m going to accept you as my faithful spouse.” And there were marriages held, and they lived pleased with each other until their death.",hDE-EN,0.3742981908920773,0.1871490954460386,0.5449792,0.53848183,0.54171103,-3.125349521636963,0.5674996897096941,0.22319135,272-German_25-False-False-False,0.1806183294652252,0.9105186462402344,0.5892968602154829,0.5137311089841914,0.5263254008560732,8.0

The youngest went into a great woods, and a storm struck, so he sought shelter in a house.  The old woman there warned him that it is a den of robbers, but he stayed, and when the robbers arrived, he persuaded them to take him on as a servant.
They set him to prove himself by stealing an ox that a man brought to market to sell.  He took a shoe with a silver buckle and left it in the road.  The man saw it and thought it would be good if only he had the other, and went on.  The son took the shoe and ran through the countryside, to leave it in the road again. The man left his ox and went back to find the other, and the son drove the ox off.
The man went back to get the second ox to sell it, and the robbers told the son that if he stole that one as well, they would take him into the band.  The son hanged himself up along the way, and when the man passed, ran on and hanged himself again, and then a third time, until the man was half-convinced that it was witchcraft and went back to see if the first two bodies were still hanging, and the son drove off his ox.
The man went for his third and last ox, and the robbers said that they would make him the band's leader if he stole it.  The son made a sound like an ox bellowing in the woods, and the man, thinking it was his stolen oxen, ran off, leaving the third behind, and the son stole that one as well.
The robbers were not pleased with his leading the band, and so they all left him.  The son drove the oxen out, so they returned to their owner, took all the treasure in the house, and returned to his father.
He decided to marry the daughter of a local squire and sent his father to ask for her hand, telling him to tell the squire that he was a Master Thief.  The squire agreed, if the son could steal the roast from the spit on Sunday.  The son caught three hares and released them near the squire's kitchen, and the people there, thinking it was one hare, went out to catch it, and the son got in and stole the roast.

The priest made fun of him, and when the Master Thief came to claim his reward, the squire asked him to prove his skill further, by playing some trick on the priest. The Master Thief dressed up as an angel and convinced the priest that he was come to take him to heaven.  He dragged the priest over stones and thorns and threw him into the goose-house, telling him it was purgatory, and then stole all his treasure.
The squire was pleased, but still put off the Master Thief, telling him to steal twelve horses from his stable, with twelve grooms in their saddles.  The Master Thief prepared and disguised himself as an old woman to take shelter in the stable, and when the night grew cold, drank brandy against it.  The grooms demanded some, and he gave them a drugged drink, putting them to sleep, and stole the horses.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal a horse while he was riding it.  The Master Thief said he could, and disguised himself as an old man with a cask of mead, and put his finger in the hole, in place of the tap.  The squire rode up and asked him if he would look in the woods, to be sure that the Master Thief did not lurk there.  The Master Thief said that he could not, because he had to keep the mead from spilling, and the squire took his place and lent him his horse to look.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal the sheet off his bed and his wife's shift. The Master Thief made up a dummy like a man and put it at the window, and the squire shot at it.  The Master Thief let it drop.  Fearing talk, the squire went to bury it, and the Master Thief, pretending to be the squire, got the sheet and the shift on the pretext they were needed to clean the blood up.
The squire decided that he was too afraid of what the thief would steal next, and let him marry his daughter.","One day, a old man sat in front of a poor house with his wife, and wanted to rest a little from work. Then suddenly came a magnificent car with four raps, from which a rich-dressed man came up. “On the face hard,” the farmer replied, “but he has a sign on himself, a mothermark on his shoulder that looks like a bean.” In these words, the stranger pulled the rock out, throwed his shoulder, and showed the farmer the bean. I am going to go to him today.” As the evening time approached, the master was sitting in his car, and went to the closet. The Count welcomed him with charity, because he considered him a man. He placed the veil on a coat, which he took on his back, and walked with suspicious, fluctuating steps to the castle of the Count. It was already dark when he arrived, he sat on a stone in the yard, began to hunt like an old breast sick woman, and broke his hands as if he was frying. “Heda, comrades,” one of those sitting in the table called, “here is a mother-in-law, that has wine, that is as old as she herself, take a drink, that heats your stomach even better than our fire.” The old man carried her cloth in the stall. One had set himself on the set body horse, the other held the yard in his hand, [483] A third had packed the wing. The one who was sitting in the seat was still sitting, but he bowed with his head almost up to the horse of the horse, and bleed with his mouth like a thumb ball. When the master saw that he was happy, he gave one a seal in his hand instead of the yard, and the other, who had held the wing, a straw. But what should he begin with the one who was sitting on the horse’s back? But he knew the good rath, and he scratched the seat, and attached a few wings, which were held in rings on the wall, to the seat, and pulled the sleeping rider with the seat up, and then he scratched the wings around the seat, and fixed them. When the day was coming, the master jumped on the stolen horse to the lock. When he came so high that the head of the dead appeared in the window, the Count, who was shooting in his bed, threw a pistol on him: As soon as the master dropped the poor sinner, the head himself jumped down and hid himself in a corner. There he was going to buri a hole in which he wanted to put him. “Dear wife,” he said with the voice of the Count, “the thief is dead, but he is my patte, and has been more a slum than a evil weight: I will not give him a prize to public shame, even with the poor parents I have compassion. What took the Count for a long face, when the Master came the next morning, and brought him the bedduck and the ring. When the night was broken, he went to the village church with a long bag on his back, a bundle under his arm, and a lottery in his hand. In the pocket he had cancer, but in the bundle short growth lights. He sat on the godsacker, took out a cancer, and wrapped a whiskey on his back. Then he burned the light, put the cancer on the ground and laid it crack. He took a second out of the pocket, did it with this as well, and continued until the last was out of the pocket. Soon the master attached the bag, packed it at the building, and dropped it down by the channels: as many times the heads of the two towers were hanging up on the stairs, he called, “Today, we’re going over the mountains.” Then he pulled them in the same way through the village, and when they came through the roofs, he called, “Now go through the wet clouds,” and when he finally lifted them up the closing stairs, he called, “Now we are on the sky stairs, and will soon be in the fortress.” When he had reached the top, he threw the bag into the dwarf, and when the dwarfs flattered, he said, “You hear the angels rejoice and strike with the fitiches.” Then he threw the ring and went on. The next morning he went to the Count, and told him that he had solved the third task, and that he had taken the priest and the coastman out of the church. “They are in a bag on the top of the tail, and form themselves as they would be in heaven.” The Count himself went up and convinced himself that he had said the truth. When he had released the priest and the coastline from the prison, he said, “You are a disgrace, and you have won your case.",hDE-EN,0.4975490196078431,0.2071078431372549,0.52221525,0.5199468,0.5210786,-3.67510986328125,0.561461826722444,-0.22989035,275-German_25-False-False-False,0.2018657814280912,0.9664134979248048,0.3982279556890018,0.4347107258425597,0.4286302641503,4.0

When they ask what it is, a farmer tells them that their mayor has bought this so-called moon and that he pours oil on it every day for a fee to keep it shining.
The boys decide to steal the moon and take it back to their country. There they also hang it on an oak tree and demand an appropriate fee from the community. As the boys grow old and realize that they will soon die, they decide one by one that each of them would like to take a quarter of the moon to his grave. In this way, the moon reaches the underworld, where its unfamiliar light awakens the dead. These become active again and begin to amuse themselves loudly. When St. Peter becomes aware of this noise, he calls together the heavenly hosts, believing that the dead are attacking.
Since there is no attack, St. Peter personally goes to the underworld, calms the dead and takes the moon to heaven, where he hangs it up.","In the early days there was a land where the night was always dark, and the heavens were broken over it like a black clay, for there was never the moon up, and no star blinked in the darkness. When the world was created, the night light was sufficient. From this land, four bourgeois walked and arrived in another kingdom, where in the evening, when the sun was gone behind the mountains, a glowing ball stood on a square tree, which extended and extended a gentle light. The walkers stood quiet and asked a farmer who passed with his car what this light is. “This is the moon,” he replied, “this is the moon that our scholars bought it for three thales and fixed it on the egg tree. He must throw oil every day and keep it clean, so that it always brings light. For this he receives a thaler from us every week.” When the farmer had gone, one of them said, “This lamp we might need, we have a tree in the house that is just so big that we can hang it. What a joy if we don’t get around in the darkness at night!” “What do you know?” said the second, “We want to take cars and horses and take the moon away. You can buy another one here.” “I can climb well,” said the third, “I want to get him down.” The fourth brought a wagon with horses, and the third climbed the tree up, [352] broke a hole into the moon, pulled a seal through, and left it down. When the bright ball was on the car, they covered a thumb on it so that no one should notice the robbery. They brought him happily into their land and put him on a high edge. Old and young were pleased when the new lamp laid its light over all the fields and filled stoves and chambers with it. The serpents came out of the rocky hills, and the little peasants danced the ring dance in their red rocks on the wieses. The four supplied the moon with oil, washed the cover and received their thaler weekly. But they became old, and when one was sick and saw his death, he ordered that the fourth piece of the moon as his property should be given to him in the grave. When he was dead, the schoolhead went up on the tree and cut down with the heck shell a quarter that was placed in the shell. When the second died, the second quarter was given to him, and the light diminished. It was even weaker after the death of the third, who also took his body, and when the fourth came into the tomb, the old darkness came back. When the people went out at night without lights, they collided with their heads. But when the moon's parts in the underworld reunited again, where darkness had dominated, the dead were unrested and awakened from their sleep. They were astonished when they could see again: the moonlight was enough for them, because their eyes were so weak that they would not be able to tolerate the brightness of the sun. The heal. Peter, who watched the heavens, believed the underworld would be in ruin, and called together the heavens who should hunt the evil enemy, if he and his companions wanted to storm the residence of the blessed.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","There was once a old king who had a daughter who was the most beautiful Virgin in the world. He made it known: “Whoever waits three nights in my old castle, the princess shall have a sleeve.” Now there was a young bourgeois, poor out of the house, who thought: I’m going to dare my life to lose nothing, to win a lot, what’s long to be done! So he stands before the king and calls for three nights in the castle. “So I’ll ask for a snorkeling bank with the snorkeling knife, a rotating bank and a fire.” All of this will be brought into the old closet. The way it begins to become dark, he goes into himself. Starting is everything quiet in it, he makes his fire, puts the knit bank next to it with the knife and sits on the rotating bank. But as it is about midnight, a rumor begins, first sacke, then stronger, bif! More and more angry, then a little bit is quiet, finally a leg comes down the shrimp and puts himself right in front of yours. “The bourgeois calls, even more comfortable, one is too little. Then the noise comes from fresh, then another leg falls down and another one and so on until it is faithful. “Now it’s enough, and they’re good for the bowling game, but the balls got still, fresh!” He is serious and falls two heads down. He puts it in the roof and rotates it: “Let the eggs go well!” Then he makes his legs straight and puts them up like the walk: “We want to play one in the corner.” “He answered, but once show your feet, you have so long nails that I will cut off you.” So he baked them on the sick, and lifted them up on the knit bank, and then he stretched them and smashed them deadly. Then he brought them out and throwed them into a small tail, in front of the lock. As he brought the rest and wanted to sit back to the fire and warm up, there came many black cats and hands, soon from all corners and always comfortable and comfortable, so that he could not get comfortable, those who screamed, came to him on his fire, watched it apart and made it all out. Then he took his snorkeling knife, “From the shadows!” and went into. A large part went away, the other smith he died and also brought them out into the tent. Then he turned the fire out of a rainbow and heated himself. When he had warmed himself, he stood and lay in a large bed standing in the corner. And when he wanted to get up to sleep, the bed began to drive and walked around the whole slot. Then the bed, like six horses, went over thresholds and thresholds: height! He threw it up to the bottom and he down. Then he swallowed roofs and pants into the hill, and went out, “May you go, who has reading!” and lay to the fire, and slept up until the day was. In the morning the king came, and when he saw the young bird sitting there and sleeping, he said, he would also be dead, and said, it was a sad thing about yours. Then the bourgeois woke up from the words, and as he saw the king, he stood up, and he asked, how would it go in the night? “Well, one will be around, the two will also go around.” The other nights went the same, but he knew how it was to attack, and on the fourth day the beautiful royal daughters were given to him.",hDE-EN,0.4534803583735354,0.1667815299793245,0.5159116,0.5347268,0.5251507,-3.584144353866577,0.5465974585156078,-0.24151877,4-German_25-True-True-True,0.0,0.9462009072303772,0.3951829039271237,0.4401177126264546,0.4326285778432327,6.0

A young servant is intrigued one night when he retrieves the King's dish and discovers a coiled white snake under the cover. The servant takes a small bite and discovers that he can now understand and communicate with animals.
Shortly afterwards the servant is accused of stealing the Queen's ring. He is given one day to prove his innocence or submit to punishment. After having given up, he sits awaiting his demise when he overhears a goose complaining about a ring stuck in her throat. The servant leaps up, grabs the goose and hurries to the kitchen, where the cook slits the goose's neck and reveals the missing gold ring. The King apologizes and offers the servant land and riches. The servant declines, accepting only a little gold and a horse on which to see the world.
On his journey to another town in another kingdom, the servant first encounters a number of animals in distress, including three fish out of water, ants at risk of being trodden upon, and starving raven fledglings in a nest. In each case the servant heeds the call for help, and in each case the grateful animals respond with ""I will remember and return the favour"".
In the next town, the servant learns that the King has announced that he wishes to marry off his daughter, but any suitor must agree to complete an arduous task to the end or be put to death. After one glimpse of the beautiful girl, the young man agrees. The King tosses a golden ring into the sea and tells the young man to retrieve it. He also adds that the young man must either bring the ring back, drown while getting the ring, or be drowned upon returning without it. However, the three fish appear, carrying a mussel with the King's ring inside.
Astonished, the King agrees to the marriage of his daughter to the servant. However, the princess sets him upon another task of refilling sacks of grain that she has spilled in the grass, because she has found out that he is not a noble and thus not her social equal. The young man is discouraged because he believes it impossible to gather all of the grain from the ground, and he lies down and falls asleep. When he wakes, he is surprised to find all the sacks are now refilled, with not one grain missing. The ant king had all of the ants working the entire night to fill them.

One of the servants was curious about what could be in the shell, and as the king once had ordered him to keep the shell, he could not keep himself calm, took it with him to his room and covered it up. And when he had discovered it, there was a white serpent in it, as he looked at it, and he also got a piece of it to eat, and cut off a piece and eaten it. But when he hardly touched his lips to the serpent, he understood the tongue of the creature, and he heard what the birds said to each other in front of the window. On the same day the queen came out of one of her most beautiful rings, and the cover fell on the eyes, and the king also said, if he did not make the thief until tomorrow, he should be punished as if it had been before. The servant was sad and went down to the king's court. Then the sheep sat at the water and rested, and when he looked at them, he heard one saying: “It’s so hard for me in the stomach that I’ve eaten a ring the queen has lost.” He took the end and brought it to the cook, saying, “Battle it, it’s so fat,” and when the cook cut off the neck and took it out, the queen’s ring was in the stomach.

He went down, took them out of the tube and brought them into the water; the fish cried: “We want to remember it and reward it.” He continued, and soon he heard a monkey king calling: “Go on with your great beast, which breaks with its wide feet all of us together.” He saw from the earth, and his horse had fallen into a monkey hole. He drove it down, and the monkey king called after him: “We want to remember it and reward it.” Then he came into a forest, and the rabbits threw their sons out of the nest, and they were big enough, they said, and they could feed themselves. The boys were on the ground and cried, they had to die from hunger, their wings would be too small, they could not yet fly and look for something. And he went down from the horse, and took his things, and cast it dead, and threw the young rabbits, who soon came, and were tired, and said, “We want to remember it and reward it.” He went on and came into a great city, where it was revealed who would have the fire, who would do what it would be given to him, if he was not in stand, he had lost his life. But there were a lot of princes there, who were all killed, so that no one wished to dare to do so. The princess made it known of faith. The young man thought he wished to do so and declared himself free. Then he was brought out to the sea, and a ring was thrown down, which he would repeat, and if he came out of the water without the ring, he would fall into the sea again, and he would die in it. But as he stood at the oven, the fish he had thrown out of the tube came into the water, and the middle man had a Misael in his mouth, and in it was the ring, the Misael he placed to his feet on the stars.

The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.

The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a ""dirty little Cinderella"" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it.

But the mother had beautiful two daughters, from her first husband, who were beautiful in face, but proud in heart and hopeful and evil. As the wedding was, and all three came into the house, the poor child was in a bad time. “What does the gentle uselessness in the dust,” said the stone mother, continuing with eggs in the kitchen, if she wants to eat bread, she must first have earned, she can be our maid.” Then the sisters took his clothes away, and took a old gray rock to him: “It’s good for you,” they said, laughed out and brought it to the kitchen. Then the poor child had to do so hard work: to get up early before the day, to carry water, to burn fire, to cook and wash, and the sisters did everything to him, burned heart, spotted it, throwed her her legacy and lenses into the ash, and he had to sit all day and read it again. At one time the king would make a covenant, which should stand in all glory three days, and his son, the prince, should choose a fellow. The two proud sisters were also invited. The next morning, the two sisters came to the kitchen, and when they saw that ashputtles read the lenses, they were evil, because they wanted to shut it, and because they couldn’t, they wandered to tell them about the bowl and said, “This was a song in the dance, the prince, the most beautiful in the world, has brought us to that, and one of us will be his companion.” “Ashenputtel said, I’ve seen the lights shine, that might have been pretty wonderful.” “I’ve stood up on the taubestone.” “When she heard this, the hatred pulled her down and ordered her that the taubestone should be destroyed. But the prince saw the car standing in front of the gate, and thought a strange princess was going to attack. When the ash was home, it went back to the tree on the mother's grave: ""Bäumlein riddle you and riddle you! “Maybe it was the one who was driving in the magnificent car with the six raps?” said Aschenputtel. In front of the door was a car with six shadows, which had high white shadows on the head, and the shadows were dressed in red and gold. When the ashes arrived, the prince stood beautifully on the bar and brought them to the hall. But the prince wanted to know who the strange princess was, where they got from and where she was going, and had placed people on the streets that should be careful about it, and so that she could not go so fast, he had made the tribe complete with luck. But because he was struggled with sorrow, one of the golden shoes remained hanging, and in fear he did not think of taking Eichen with him. But in the light he heard the one saying, “God knows who the desirable princess is, that she should be buried in the earth! “The mother secretly said, ‘You have a knife, and if the shoe is too narrow to you, cut off a piece of your foot, it makes a bit of the wave, but it will be damaged, and one of you will be a queen.’” Then the oldest went into her room and tried the shoe, and the footstep came in, but the brush was too big, and she took the knife and cut herself a piece of the brush until she pushed the foot into the shoe. So she went out to the prince, and when he saw that she was holding the shoe, he said that it was the bride, and led her to the car, and wanted to go on with the sheep. Then she took the shoe into her room, and when the foot was too big, she got the teeth together and cut a large piece of the teeth away, and pressed the shoe quickly. But when he came to the gate, the dwarfs again cried, “Remove the look, Remove the look! Blood is in shock: the shock is too small, the right bride is still sitting at home. The prince looked down, and the white stripes of the bride were red, and the blood was flowing up. Then the prince brought her back to the mother and said, “This is not the right bride. But there is no daughter in the house.” “The mother said, there is only one butterfly butterfly still there, which is sitting down in the ash, which the shoe can’t base. And if he fits you, you will be my companion.” Then he pulled the heavy shoe out of the left foot, put his eyes on the golden shoe, and pressed a little bit, and it stood in it as if he was attached to him. And when it came up, the prince looked in his face, and he recognised the beautiful princess again and called, “This is the right bride.” The shepherd mother and the two proud sisters were scared and bleached, but the prince carried the ashes and lifted it into the wagon, and when they drove through the door, the dolls cried:",hDE-EN,0.5080160320641283,0.2074148296593186,0.554288,0.5480716,0.5511623,-3.603811025619507,0.5593225305012259,-0.7782034,21-German_25-True-True-True,0.0971698059698054,0.9480037689208984,0.189236857525648,0.4280325036783477,0.3882332293195644,9.0

The next day, the Bird suggests that they switch roles and refuses to go to the forest. The Mouse and the Sausage oppose the idea at first, but in the end, they give in. The Bird now is responsible for bringing home the water, the Mouse cooks, and the Sausage goes to the forest to collect wood.
The Sausage leaves to gather wood in the forest early in the morning but does not come home again. The Bird gets worried and starts looking for it. Soon, it finds a dog, who has attacked and eaten the Sausage. The Bird lodges a complaint against the dog, but the dog lies and says that the Sausage was carrying forged letters, and therefore it needed to be punished with its life. The Bird cannot argue, so it goes home and tells the Mouse what has happened. They decide that they will have to do their best themselves from now on.
The Mouse starts to cook. It imitates the Sausage, rolling himself in the pot to mix and season the food. However, the Mouse cannot stand the heat and burns to death.

In order to put out the fire, the Bird goes to the well to get some water. It falls into the well after dropping the bucket. The Bird cannot get back out and drowns.","There were once a mouse, a bird, and a brass in communities, they had a household, lived long weekly and deliciously in peace, and grew well in goods. The work of the bird was that it should fly in the forest every day and wood should be reduced. The mouse should carry water, fire umma and cover the table, but the bread root should cook. Whoever is on a week, he is always rewarded by faithful things. So one day, on the way, another bird hit the bird, to whom it tells and encourages his great opportunity. The same other bird, however, has a poor drop, the great work, which both have good days at home. For when the mouse had carried fire and water, it went down in a cement, until it was called to cover the table. The wheat stayed at the port, saw that the food was cooking a week, and when it was soon a meal, it was twice broken through the width or the vegetable, so it was painted, salty and prepared: Then the bird came home and put down his boards, so they sat at the table, and after that they slept their skin full until the other morning, and that was a wonderful life. The bird another day did not want to be comfortable in the wood, speaking: It would be long enough servant knew, and would have to be equally crazy, they should once change and try it in a different way too. And as weekly the mouse strongly asked for it, even the wheat, so the bird was master, it had to be courageous, they played against it, and the loos came on the wheat to carry the wood that the mouse had to cook, and the bird had to wheat water. What a story? The breadworm went on to wood, the bird made fire, the mouse came to the pot and waited alone until the breadworm came home and brought wood for the other day. But the crop stayed so long. They had not seen anything good to them, and the bird flew a piece of air. But if there is a dog on the way, who finds the poor wheat as a free beat, packed and lay down. The bird also complained of it as an obvious robbery, but it did not help a word, because the hand said that he had found false letters at the brush, so it would have fallen away from his life. The bird, sadly, took the tree on and home and told what it saw and heard. They were shy, but compared the best to do and stay together. So the bird covered the table, and the mouse prepared the food and wanted to make up, and in the port, like the curtain before, and through the flavour sliding and sliding, to mix the same; But when she came in the middle, she was stopped, and she had to leave her skin and hair and life. When the bird came, he wanted to apply the food, there was no cook. The bird throwed the wood down and down, called and sought, but could not find his cook more comfortable. And the fire came into the tree, so that a brush came out. The bird kept the water too long, and the eagles recommended it in the fountain, and it came down, so that it could not be more comfortable, and it had to go there.",hDE-EN,0.4700665188470066,0.2461197339246119,0.5019406,0.53904605,0.5198321,-2.992082595825196,0.568902436475789,-0.3117405,23-German_25-True-True-True,1.2888730763583491,0.9595302939414978,0.3647130415004286,0.4244438503242173,0.4144887155202524,9.0

She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her.

Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden.

The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

Franz Jüttner's illustrations from Sneewittchen (1905)","It was once in the middle of the winter, and the snow flocks fell like feathers from the sky, then a beautiful queen sat on a window that had a frame of black edge wood, and wet. And as she looked and looked after the snow, she stumbled with the needle into the fingers, and three drops of blood fell into the snow. The Queen was the most beautiful in the whole country, and even proud of her beauty. She also had a mirror, before which she stood every morning and asked, “Mrs. Queen, you are the most beautiful woman in the country.” And she knew that no one was better in the world. But Snowwittchen grew up, and when she was seven years old, it was so beautiful that the queen itself exceeded the beauty, and when she asked her mirror, “Play on the wall, who is the most beautiful woman in the whole country?” the mirror said, “Mrs. Queen, she’s the most beautiful here, but Snowwittchen is a thousand times more beautiful than she’s!” As the queen heard the mirror speak so, she was blown to jealousy, and from stand to stand she hated the snowflower, and when she looked at it, and thought that by her fault she was not the most beautiful one in the world, the heart turned around. Then the wrath left no rest, and she called a hunter and said to him, ""Take the snowflower out into the forest in a wide remote place, where the wrath is dead, and bring me his long and his liver to the sight, which I will cook and eat with salt."" The hunter took the snowboat and brought it out, but as he had pulled the hunt and wanted to look up, then it began to cry, and so asked the witcher, he could let his life, he never wanted to come back, but to continue in the forest. But Snowwittchen was alone in the great forest, so that he was very afraid, and began to walk and walk over the top stones, and through the dorns all day: finally, when the sun wanted to fall, it came to a small house. Then he tried the seven bedlins each other, but no one was right to him, except the seventh day, in which he lay and slept. The first said, “Who is sitting on my chair?” The second said, “Who has eaten of my plate?” The third said, “Who took my bread?” The fourth said, “Who has eaten my vegetables?” The fifth asks, “Who has struck me?” The sixth said, “Who has cut my knife?” The seventh said, “Who has drank out of my thing?” Then the first looked around and said, “Who came into my bed?” The two said, “Is there someone in me?” and so all went up until the seventh, as he saw after his bed, and he found the snowboat in it and slept. But because no one, when the seven dwarfs were in the seven mountains, knew that it had been saved to them, and now he sent her from faith how she could kill it, for as long as the mirror did not say that she would be the most beautiful woman in the whole country, she had no calm. She knocked at the door and called, “stay up, stay up, I’m the old cremer who has good good goods wrong.” Snow White looked out of the window: “What do you have?” “Dear child,” said the old man, and took an aven that was flown of yellow, red and blue seed, “will you have it?” “Yes,” said Sneewittchen, and thought the good old woman I could leave in for a week, the one of my words. So the door went up and the snorkelers acted. Soon after that was the night, the seven wolves came to the house, who were scared when they found a beautiful snowflower lies on the earth as if it was dead. “There was no one but the queen,” they said, “who wanted to take your life, take care of you, and let no man comfort in.” But the queen cried out before her mirror, saying to her, “So shall the snowman die, and if it cost my life.” Then she went into her secret dust, and no one had to come before her, and there she made a toxic, toxic apple, outside it was beautiful and red-becked, and each of the eyes saw, received a song about it. After that, she wounded herself as a farmer, walked in front of the tiger house and knocked. But the queen was glad, went to the house and asked the mirror: Playing on the wall: who is the most beautiful woman in the whole country? He said, “Mrs. Queen, you are the most beautiful woman in the land.” “Now I’m calm,” she said, as I’m the most beautiful again in the country, and this time Snow White will be dead for a week.” The snorkeling came to the house in the evening from the mines, where the beloved Snow White was on the ground and was dead. Then they made a shark of glass, and put it in, so that it could be seen, and wrote on it with gold letters his name and his descent, and one stayed at the house every day and awakened it. Once a young prince came to the tiger house and wanted to stay in it, and when he came into the dust and saw Snow White lies in the glassarg on which the seven lines throw their shade so straight, he could not get tired of his beauty, and read the golden inscription and saw that it was a royal sister. Then he asked the cowgirl, that they should sell him the shark with the dead snorkel, but they did not want all gold. Then he asked them, they could give it to him, he could not live without seeing it, and he wanted to keep it as high and thick as his love in the world. Then the gentlemen were compassionate, and they gave him the sword, but the prince laid Eichen in his castle, and laid Eichen in his dust; he himself sat with him all day, and could not turn his eyes away. And if he had to go out, and could not see snowflakes, he was sad, and he could not eat bits, if the shark did not stand next to him. But the servants, who had to constantly carry the shark, were evil about it, and one once made the shark up, lifted snow wheels into the hill, and said, ""For a girl's sake, we'll struggle all day,"" and gave him a stump in his back with his hand. Then the thick apple grain, which it had broken out, took him out of his neck, and Snow White was alive again. Then it came to the prince, who didn’t know what to do before joy, when his beloved Snow White was alive, and they sat together on the table and ate in joy. On the other day the wedding was placed, and Sneewittchen's wicked mother was also invited. As she stood before the mirror in the morning and said, “Light burned, and she shouldn’t stop until she had danced to death.”",hDE-EN,0.4698385726423109,0.1928632115548003,0.60070753,0.60074055,0.60072404,-3.107471466064453,0.5617086861569072,-0.63038945,52-German_25-True-True-True,2.041718419256789,0.9560530185699464,0.2688722245026685,0.5230154322804941,0.4806582309841898,6.0

They were glad about their find, and they went to the gold shmid, who said it was fine gold and gave them a lot of money for it. The next morning they went back into the forest, and they found a gold like that, and the bird allowed it to take it patiently, as it was before. It lasted for a time, and every morning they took the gold and were soon rich; but one morning the bird said, “I will not put any eggs in the midst, but bring me to the gold shmidt, that will be your happiness.

She could lure wild animals and birds to her before killing them for food. She froze to stone any man who would dare come near where she stood, and turned innocent maidens into birds and caged them. Jorinde and Joringel, two lovers engaged to be married, went for a walk in the forest. They came too near to the witch's lair. She turned Jorinde into a nightingale and petrified Joringel to the ground. Once she had carried away the bird, she freed Joringel, laughing that he would never see Jorinde again.
One night Joringel dreamed of a flower and that it would break all the witch's spell. He sought it for nine days, found it, and carried it back to the castle. He was not frozen to the ground when he approached the castle and all of the doors opened. He found the witch feeding the birds. She was unable to curse him. When she tried to take one cage away, he realized it was Jorinde. He touched the witch with the flower and her evil magic left her forever.

On the day she made herself a cat, or a nighttime, but on the evening she was shaped as a man. She could catch the wild and the birds, and then she buried it, cooked and saved it. If a man approached the castle a hundred steps, he had to stand quietly, and could not move from the place until she spoke out; but if a wicked virgin came into this circle, she turns it into a bird, and then wipes it into a basket, into the chambers of the castle. She had a week of seven thousand such curves with such rare birds in the castle. Now there was once a virgin named Jorinde. She was more beautiful than all the other girls who, and then a pretty young man named Joringel, had promised together. They were in the wedding days, and they had the greatest pleasure one by another. In order for them to be able to talk familiarly together, they went to the forest to walk.

Jorinde sang, “Fly around her three times, and shout three times, here, here, here.” Now the sun was down; The oils flew into a straw, and immediately thereafter came an old crown woman from this aven, yellow and mager, big red eyes, crown nose, which drove with the head of the kid. She murmured, began the night sound, and carried it on her hand. “Wine mandel appears in the body, bind off, Zachel, to good state.” Then Joringel went away. He fell to the Kenas before the woman, and asked them to give him his Jorinds again. But she said he should never have them again, and went away.

In the morning, God grants them three wishes, and the man chooses bliss, health, and gets a nicer house to boot. When the rich man hears this, he gets angry. His wife makes him follow the wanderer and also ask for three wishes. God advises against it, but on the way home he thinks frantically how he could wish for enough.

At home he wants to think about the remaining wish alone, but has to redeem his wife from the saddle.","Before ancient times, when the beloved God himself walked on earth among men, it was assumed that he was one night and that when the night was over, he could come to a hostel. And on the way before him two houses stood in front of each other, one big and beautiful, the other small and poor, and he heard that one rich and the other poor. Our Lord God thought that to the rich I would not fall trouble and knocked at the door with him. Then the rich opened his window and asked what he wanted. “A night camp.” The rich looked Eichen from his head to his feet, and because the beloved God was simply wearing clothes and didn’t look like one who had a lot of money in the pocket, he scratched his head and said, “I can’t take you, my chambers are full of seeds, and if I would host anyone who knocked my door, I should go away soon; Look for an outcome elsewhere.” He opened his window and left the beloved God standing. So the beloved God turned his back, went over to the small house and knocked. He had hardly climbed, and the arms also sounded his thorn and asked the walker to enter and stay with him the night: “It’s pretty dark,” he said, “and today you can’t go further.” It liked the beloved God and he entered. The wife of the poor gave him the hand, he called Eichen welcome and said, he liked to make the seaches comfortable and take pre-love, they would not have fallen, but what it would be, they would love from heart. Then she put potatoes on the fire, and while they cooked, she melked her cows, so that they could have a bit of milk. As they had eaten and was sleepy, the woman secretly called her husband and said, ‘Listen, dear man, we’ll make a struggle there at night, so that the poor walker can sit in our bed and rest, he has passed the whole day, and there will be a struggle.’ From heart the man pleased to speak, I want to tell him, went to the beloved God and asked Eichen, weeping would be right to him, I would like him to lie in a loose bed and rest his limbs properly. The beloved God didn’t want to take the two old wicked camps, but they didn’t let them go until he finally did it and lay in a wicked bed. But they made themselves a strike on the earth. On the other day before the day, they stood well up and cooked a poor breakfast for him. When the day was full, and the king stood up and lay in the window, he saw a beautiful faithful house standing in front of the old house. Then he turned his eyes, called his wife and said, “Look, how did this go? Now the woman went and asked, but the poor told Eich: “Yesterday evening came a walker who sought night hostels and this morning, when he said goodbye, he gave us three wishes: eternal happiness, health in this life, and the necessary daily bread, and instead of our old house a beautiful faithful house.” When the wealthy’s wife heard this, she ran again and told her husband, who said, “I would like to break and break, if I knew that, the stranger has also been with me, but I have rejected it.” “Speak,” said the woman, “and sit on your horse; the man is not far yet; you have to pick up your ear and give you three wishes.” Then the ruler stood up and took the beloved God in, spoke gently and gently to him, and said that he shouldn't take it badly, that he shouldn't go in, that he would have sought the key out of the door, and that he would have gone away. When he returns, he must return to him.” “Yes, said the dear God, when he comes back, he wants to do that.” Then the rich asked if he should not do three desires like his neighbor? “The beloved God said that he could do it a week, but it would not be good for you, and would rather not wish anything.” But the rich thought he wanted to choose something good if it was fulfilled. But because he was funny, he didn’t want to leave the seat, cut it off, hang it on his back, and now he had to walk to the house. But he comforted himself that he would have two wishes left. As he went through the sand, and as the sun burned hot at noon, he was so warm and trembling to the courage, the seat was pushing an eagle on his back, he was still unthinking what he should be ashamed. If he thought he had something, then it seemed to him too little and too little. Then he thought what his wife is right now, sitting at home in a cool dust and letting it taste well. The angry Eugen ordinarily and without knowing it, he said: “I want the seat at home on the seat, and I can’t go down, rather than I’m sliding it on my back.” And as the words ended, the seat was gone from his back, and he noticed that his two wishes had also been fulfilled. Then he was very hot and he began to walk and wanted to sit alone at home and think about what was great for the last desire. But when he came and opened the door, his wife was sitting on the seat and couldn’t go down, jamming and writing. Then he said, “Give you pleasure, I will wish you all the wealth of the world, but stay there.” She said, “What help me all the wealthy people in the world when I sit on the seat, you wish me, you must help me again.” If he wanted or not, he had to do the third desire, that she could only be from the seat and descend, and that was fulfilled.

But the young knees cried and laughed, and when their parents brought food again, they said, “We do not eat flying legs, and we should die hungry until the eggs become poor, whether we are honest children or not, for the bear has been there and has swallowed us.” Then the old king said, “Be quiet, that shall be done.” He flown with the wife Queen to the bear in front of her cave and called into it, “You have slaughtered my children, that will hurt you, that will we do in a bloody war.” So the bear was announced war, and all the four-foot Gethai were called: Height, Esel, Bear, Hirsch, Reh and what the earth is carrying everything else. But the wicked king told everything that was flying in the air, not only the birds big and small, but also the mice, horns, legs and flies had to pass. When the time came, when the war was to come, the Zaunking king sent the chancellor who would be the commandant general of the enemy. The muck was listic, swallowed in the forest, where the enemy gathered, and finally sat under a sheet on the tree, where the words were issued. Then the bear stood, calls the fearful before himself, and says, ""You are the clever among all things, you shall be the general and guide us: what signs shall we bring?"" Then the fear said: “I have a beautiful, long, bushed wing, which looks almost like a red beam; when I keep it up, the thing goes well, and I have to go on, but I let the eyes hang down, so start and run.” When the mucke had heard this, she flown back home and gave the king all the hair. When the day entered where the battle should be delivered, today! Then came the four-foot ghetto apart with Geras, so that the earth stumbled. The wicked king with his army also came through the air, which cried, cried, and cried, that a fear became. And they went there from both sides. But the wicked king sent the horns down, and they should sit under the wing of fear, and put out of body forces. Now, as the fearful got the first steak, he throwed up that one leg, but he suffered it, and left the wing up. At the second he must let the eyen down for a moment, but at the third he could not stay comfortable, screamed and took the swing between his legs. As the beasts saw this, they thought everything would be lost and began to run, each into his caves, and the birds had won the battle. Then the Lord King and the wife of the Queen fled home to their children and cried, “Children be glad, eat and drink according to the heart’s desire, we have won the war.” The young kings said, “We shall not eat yet; the bear shall come before the nest and pray and say that we are honest children.” Then the king fled before the bear's hole, and said, ""You shall go before the nest to my children and pray and say that they are honest children, otherwise your ribs in the body shall be broken.""

This takes so long that he must stay another night, and in return she asks him to chop her wood. Once again, he must stay another night.

The following day, she requests that he go into a well and retrieve her blue light for her. He is in the process of doing so, but realizes he is being tricked and will be trapped in the well as soon as he gives it to her. He keeps the light for himself, not knowing what it is, but she leaves him in the well. He decides to smoke one last time and lights his pipe with the blue light.

To retaliate against the king, the soldier commands the dwarf to bring him the princess so she can act as his maid. When she wakes up, the princess tells her father of her strange ""dream"", which the king believes could have actually happened. He has the princess fill her pocket with peas and put a little hole in it so that if she actually is carried away they will be able to follow the path.

He did not know what to spend his life, and went sadly on the long day and came in a forest at night. As he had gone, he saw a light, which he approached, and came to a small house, in which a old witch lived. He asked for a night camp and a little food and a little drink, but she gave him it, and she finally said, “I will welcome you with mercy, but tomorrow you will buri me all my garden.” The soldier promised it and was therefore hosted. On the other day he hunted the witch around the garden and had work with it until the evening, and now he wanted to send her away, but he said: “I’m so much,” let me stay here for the night. She didn’t want, she finally admitted it, but he’ll have to split a little fiber of wood another day. The soldier hunted the tree on the two days, and had done it in the evening so that he could not leave again, so he prayed at the third night. But the next day he should hole the blue light from the fountain. Then Eugen led the witch to a fountain, and band Eugen to a long seal, to which she left Eugen down. And when he was down, he found the blue light, and made the sign that they should rise up again. She moved Eugen also to the height, but as he was on the edge, so close that you could reach your hands, she wanted to have the light to let Eugen then fall down again. But he noticed their evil thoughts and said, “Hey, I don’t give the blue light until I stand on the ground with my feet.” Then the witch broke up and hit Eichen with gathering the light down into the fountain and went on. The soldier down in the dark, moist morast was sad, for his end was before him, and his pipe fell into his hand, which was still half full, and he thought that you would still drink it for the last pleasure. So he put them on the blue light and began to smoke. “When the vapor walked a little, a small black man came and asked, ‘What do you tell me? I have to serve you in everything.” “Help me first of all from the fountain. Then Eugen took the black man at his hand and brought Eugen up, and the blue light took them with. When they were up, the soldier said, “Now the old witch killed me.” When the man did that, the treasures and the gold of the witches were revealed to him, and the soldier called it up and took it with him. Then the man said: “If you need me, just put your pipe on the blue light.” Then the soldier went to the city and to the best hostel, and he made beautiful clothes and built a beautiful room. When it was done, he called his man and said, “The king has sent me out and left me hungry, because I could not make his services more convenient, now bring me the queen here at night, and she shall wait for me and do what I call it.” The man said, “This is a dangerous thing.” But it went and took the king's daughters sleeping out of their bed and brought them to the soldier, to whom they had to obey and do what he wanted. In the morning, she drove the black man back. When she stood up, she told her father: “I had a wonderful dream that night, as if I had been taken away from a soldier and had to wait for him.” Then the king said, “Take your pocket full of heritage, and put a hole in it, that the dream may be true, and then they fall out and leave the trace on the road.” So she did, but the man had heard what the king had heard. As the evening came, and the soldier said that he should regain the royal daughters to him again, then he struggled the whole city with heritage, and the few who fell out of their pocket could not track, and the next morning the people had to read heritage all the day. The queen told her father what Eich had met, and he said, “Take a shoe and cover the Eich secretly where you are.” The black man heard this, and as the soldier wanted to bring the king's daughters, he said to him: “Now I can’t help you more, you’ll be unhappy when it comes out.” But the soldier stood upon his will. “So just get out of the gate early in the morning,” the man said, “when I took it away.” The queen kept a shoe, and hid her eyes in bed with the soldier. The next morning, when she was again with her father, the man found her everywhere in the city, and then he was found with the soldier. He had made himself out of the dust, but soon was captured and thrown into a firm prison. Then he was sitting in chains and bonds, and over the holy flower his best was stained, the blue light and the gold, and he had nothing left but a ducat. Now as he so sadly stood at the window of his prison, he saw a cammerade passing, whom he called and spoke. “If you bring me the little bowl that I have left in the hostel, I will give you a ducat.” Then he went and brought him the blue light and the gold for the Duke. The prisoner immediately put his pipe and let the black man come and said to him: “Be without fear, go calmly to the court and let everything happen, only take the blue light with you.” Then he was hearing, and he was judged that he should be hanged on the gal. As he was brought out, he asked the king for a grace. “I’m allowed to smoke a pipe on the way.” “You can smoke three if you want,” the king said. Then he pulled out his pipe and burned it on the blue flame, as soon as the black man came to the edge. “There all kill me,” said the soldier, and the king in three pieces.

And the mother, who was alone now on the whole of the goddess, felt a great and unnamed pain, and she did not eat, and did not drink, and was crying, again crying for three days, and for three nights, without ceasing, and called for her child. Now as she was so full of deep suffering in the third night, in the place where the child was dead, tired and painful until the end of power, the door opened quietly, and the mother cried together, for the child of the child was dead before the child of the child. It became a blessing and smiled sweet as innocence and beautiful as in explanation. But he had a rope in his hands, which was surely overfilled. And the child said, “O dear mother, don’t cry pleasantly about me! See, in this curvature are thy tears that thou shed around me. The angel of faith has gathered them in this vessel. If you are only crying around me, the rope will float, and I will not have peace in the grave, nor happiness in heaven. “Therefore, my dear mother, don’t cry pleasantly about your child, for your child is pleased, he is happy, and angels are his games.” Thus, the dead child disappeared, and the mother continued to cry without a mourning mourning, so that the child could not interfere with the tomb and heavenly peace.",hDE-EN,0.2570694087403599,0.1542416452442159,0.4933404,0.6147852,0.547408,-2.3857245445251465,0.5497452434202313,-0.63952017,179-German_25-True-True-True,0.8338740666012462,0.927680492401123,0.2436534141625089,0.4359497834922175,0.4039003886039327,7.0

When her thread breaks, the woman disappears.
The brothers scatter in fright. Goldener can no longer find his way home and only after several days he meets a birdcatcher who teaches him his trade. When Goldener catches a white finch to test his skills, the birdcatcher believes that Goldener is in league with the devil, kills the bird and chases Goldener away.
After three days of wandering in the forest, Goldener meets a gardener who apprentices him. After a few days, the gardener sends him into the forest so that Goldener can bring him a rosebush on which to graft noble roses. When Goldener returns with a rosebush of beautiful golden roses, the gardener is incensed because he thinks Goldener has made a pact with the devil, destroys the rosebush and drives Goldener away.
After three days, Goldener leaves the forest behind and reaches the sea, where he boards a barque when the fishermen suddenly row out to sea. There Goldener is to cast the net, when he pulls up a golden crown, the fishermen inform him that he is the new king of the land. The old king had been left without a successor a hundred years ago, and before his death he had sunk his crown in the sea and appointed as his successor the one who could snatch it back from the sea.","A long time ago, a poor shepherd lived in a dense forest, who had built a bretter house in the middle of the forest, in which he lived with his wife and six children, who were all boys. In the house was a fountain and a garden, and when the father fed the beast, the children went out and brought him a cold drink from the fountain or a dish from the garden for lunch or evening. To the youngest, the parents only cried, ""for his hair was like gold, and though the youngest, he was the strongest of all, and the greatest. One night, on the way back from the Father, the boys were thrilled with playing in the forest, and Goldene had appeared, above all, so clearly in the game that he looked as bright as the evening. Then suddenly there came light between the dark tanden aven and a female shape, shining like the moon, sitting on one of the mosaic stones, spanning with a crystal spindle a light fade out in the night, genicking with the head against the golden and singing: “The white finger, the golden rose, the queen in the sea shoot!” She would have been singing a week further, as the wheels broke the fades and release them like a light. Now it was all night, the children got a grace, they jumped with a crazy scream, one into there, the other into there, over rocks and rocks, and lost one to the other. A week many days and nights honored the gold in the thick forest, but neither one of his brothers, nor the house of his father, nor the trace of a man found, for the forest was even narrow, one mountain placed over the other, and one cave among the other. On the same knowledge, Garne was designed, for there was a bird maker, who made birds flying out of the forest, and brought them into the city to buy. “I just need a bursch,” thought the bird, looking at the golden, who was standing near the gardens on the green wise and in the wide blue sky and could not see himself tired. The birdmaker wanted to have fun, he pulled his garne and hated! “So you’ll catch the birds that come out of the forest,” said the bird maker, “your red feeds are right up to me. Goldene pulled the garne and at the first kick he started a snow-white fink. “Back yourself with this white fence!” The bird creator cried, “You have to do with the evil!” and so he hit the wisdom unhappyly, by breaking the white fence that gold had been given to him, under many desires with his feet. Goldene could not understand the word of the bird maker, he went sad but comforted, back into the forest and again decided to look for the cottage of his father. “I just need such a bear!” and the door of the garden closed. Goldene liked it, because he had a long life among the flowers, especially because he had completely abandoned the hope to find the house of his father. “Go to the forest,” the gardener said to Goldene one morning, “I have a wild rose, so that I can plant roses on it.” Goldene went and came back with a layer of the most beautiful gold-colored roses, which were not different as if they had wrapped the skilled gold shade for the table of a king. “Back yourself with these golden roses!” The gardener cried, “You have to do with the evil,” and thus he caught out of the garden, by putting the golden roses into the earth under many disgrace. He walked day and night, from tree to tree, from rocks to rocks. Goldene liked it, because he had a golden life in the waves, especially because he had abandoned the hope to find his father's house again. A hundred years ago, the old king, who had no inheritors, drowns his crowns into the sea, and so long as any happy man had determined the fate to pull the crown out of the depth, the throne would be filled with loyalty without a successor.” “Hello our king!” the fishermen called, and the goldmen put the crown up. The client of Goldene and the refined royal crown soon entered the land from ship to ship and over the sea. Then the golden area was soon occupied by colourful nails and by ships that were drawn with flowers and labyrinths. They greeted all the ship on which King Goldene stood. He stood, the bright crown on the head, on the front of the ship, and looked quietly to the sun as it leaves in the sea.

His mother still tries to have it killed by the servant, is herself put into the hole, the swans redeemed, except for one, of which one finds ""in many a book much strange adventure described.""","In one land there was a young Knight who was rich and beautiful, and had a magnificent castle. At one time he ridered with his dogs into the forest to hunt, and he saw a hindu, which was white than the snow, and fled up before him and from it to the mountains between the wild high rivers. Over it he came to a river where he saw a beautiful virgin standing, washing and wearing a curved chain in his hand. The time came when the young woman came into the child’s bed, and praised six sons and a daughter, who had all the gold rings around their heels. Soon the old wicked woman, the mother of the young Lord, came, and took the seven children, while the mother was sleeping, and took them away, and placed seven young dogs, which were thrown in the same night, in their place. Now this false and unfaithful woman had a familiar servant, to whom she answered the seven children, and committed Eyes of loyalty and jury to carry them into the wild forest, to kill them, and to be buried in the earth or to drown in the water. The servant promised to do this, brought the little girl into the forest, put her under a tree and prepared to burn her. But the Creator of all beings, who directed all things to the best, mercyed the little one and sent them a feeding father, which was an old wise master who lived in the valley to preserve wisdom, who took the little one into his cage and fed them with the milk of the shepherds who were used to come to him, for seven years. When that evil woman had taken the children away from her mother, she brought her son to the young woman, showed her the puppy and said, “Son, the children that your wife had born to you are young hands.” She did this for revenge to her son because he loved the young woman so much. When he saw this, he believed in his mother, and threw a hatred on the young woman, whom he loved so much, nor wanted to hear a word of apology, but he let her be buried in the ground on the courtyard before the palace of his castle to the chest, and on the wicked head he placed a washing bag with water, and ordered all his sister to wash over her head and dry her hands on her beautiful hair. At home he told his mother and other gentlemen and friends that he saw small children in the forest with gold cakes on the holes. After that, she commanded the servant to ride quickly into the forest, to look for the children who have not died with them, and to take the golden chains from them, otherwise they would both be scattered. As the servant presented the chains of the elders, he sent them to a gold shade and called Eichen to make a cup of the same. “When the gold spider sought to throw a cup of the chains, he captured that the gold was noble and pure, so that it could not be processed with the hammer or flushed in the fire, except on a chain, which he broke down and made a ring of it. The others he woke on his wage, put them side by side, and gave so much different weight of gold and made a cup of it, which he gave to the woman and also the ring, which closed both in their box. Then they saw a great mirror, on which they lay down. Then they gave the waste from the table, and she shared it with the poor woman in the grave, for whenever she saw it, she had to cry bitterly. But if you ask for the swords, these are my brothers who were fed with me by the milk of the Hindu in the forest. And he took a white sword, and followed the little girl, when it came down to the swords according to his habit. Only the Lord witnessed his, came, and as the servant sought the miset near, he shot his sword out of his hand. Then the Knight came to his mother and forced her to confess with threats. Then she closed up her box and gave the son the cup that was to be made from the chains. Now that he was also concerned about the punishment, he knew the truth that he still had the whole chains, except one from which he made a ring. The Knight called Echen to bring the chains, and gave them to the Virgin. He put the swords, each one around the neck. Now the Knight sacredly took the poor woman out of the earth, and made her relaxed with noble spices and precious warts, so that she became a beautiful woman again.

But this mountain was calmed, and the animals were safe from other animals and dwelled in unity with each other. Among them was also a shark of mouse dogs or cats who had a king. Now the wolf was got through the hole with a list, hidden and started a cat every day and ate it. That was the cat secher sorry, and they gathered out of advice among their king; and there were in particular three wise, insightful cats who called the king in his advice and asked the first about his vote against the harmful wolf. The first cat said: “I do not know any advice against this great misfortune but to command us in God’s grace, for how could we resist the wolf? “The king asked the two cats, and he said, “The I recommend that we leave this place together and look for another quieter place, as we have to go here in great trouble, body and life danger. “And the third cat said to the king’s question: “The My advice is to stay here and not escape through the wolf. I also knew a advice to overcome yours. “Say yours,” the king commanded, and the cat continued to say, “We must be careful that if the wolf has made a faithful beet and wherever he carries and eats it, then you, o king, and I and our strongest have to approach him, as if we wanted to eat what he left, so he will consider himself completely safe and no fear of us. Then I will jump on the eyes and cut out his eyes, and then all the others must fall on the eyes, so that he cannot resist our comforts, and we must not be mistaken, that one or the other of us will hurt life or bear wounds away. For by this we save ourselves and our children from the enemy, and a wise man does not divide himself from his father's heritage with fears and fears. No, he defends it with body and life danger.

And the bird Holgotha, who became old and weak, and his wife had the bird mass much better in their hearts than he will show them, as it appears. And came a dirty hot time, and everything was dirty, and the sight drowned, and the fish died. Vogel Massa said to himself, “It’s a good thing about faithful friendship, and it’s fun to keep friends together. But each one is the next one. Who is not useful to himself, how can the other be useful? Whoever does not predict future harm and escapes eiken, he will not escape him when he is there. Now I see how the communities of these birds will hurt and destroy me, because the food is reducing from day to day. And ultimately they will hunt me. But I like this week, and I could also live here alone, without those societies. It would be good for a week if I preached them and freed me from them, first of all from the man, for the woman trusts me entirely, and then I force them unevenly easier.

One thing only I know, which I have given you, if my advice does not ignore you.” “Who is this?” asked the woman, and Massa said, “The band of friendship is more comfortable than the band of blood-related, because it is often more harmful than poison. A speech says: Whoever lacks a brother, has a fewer enemy; and whoever has no relatives, has no jealousy. But it would be light for me to suffer the death for your sake. Say that way! For whoever does not live his life for a faithful friend, he is a witcher; for a friend is more useful as a brother or as a child.” Now Massa spoke with Arglist: “My advice is that you seek to get rid of your old weak man and be alone, for whom you have to take care so hard. There will be happiness and healing for you, and I will be with you.

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","There were once two brothers, one of whom, the oldest, did not fall on the head, but was unpleasant and pfiffy over all dimensions. But the younger had, as they say, a plate in front of his head. This greatly concerned the Father, but he did not, for he lived in the world without caution and without caution, as the Taumelst lived, and he liked weekly, without he knowing, having the speech in his head: Do not learn too much, you have to do too much.

Now they are not good; The coastline prosecuted Eichen with his father, and he became very wild and cried, “A twelve-night is the boy, let him look out of my eyes!”, my good companion, the grain learn much better when one is alone than when he is two. Thus he found the man with whom he went yesterday, and who today came to hole the money. That’s why he continued to take nothing to the lock, but a good fire, a cutting bank and a rotating bank, “so I don’t get more free,” he said, “and I can waste time.” “It was pleased to be given to the handman, and he set up his seat in a beautiful room with a large fire in the old closet. Then they bite after him, and he took his knife and cut off their heads, and throwed cat heads and bodies out of the window into the closet tombs. When he came back to the fire, a large dog sat there and bleached his teeth, and had a fireful tongue and a handful to his neck. This didn’t like Hanshen again, he took his knife again and thus raised the dog just between the teeth in the neck, then the tongue fell down and the upper head took goodbye to his other. The next morning the king stood at his bed and said, “I will have a healthy sleep if I have it! Hanshen took the two halves, throwed them out of the stone into the dust, and brought his fire back in order.

Suddenly, a great rumor emerged, six men entered the room, who carried a deadload on the bar, eceling them in front of the hangs and disappeared. “The free, he’s soap before the frost,” Hansen said, “I have to warm it!” He raised the dead out of the disaster and brought Eyes to his fire, but he remained cold. “Nine weeks,” said Hanshen, “give the thing out, but until I have it, you stay in the neck and wear the scroll on your shoulders.” It was a look uncomfortable wearing, the bank on the shoulders, and the bar into the wheel, which pulled. “I got a box full of gold, one for you and one for the poor.

During this hike, one evening he and a circular smith accompanying him stop at an inn, where he meets a student and a wagoner. This inn is located in the Spessart region, which is notorious for robberies. The four men decide not to go to bed in order to avoid being robbed. In order not to be overcome by sleep, they tell each other four fairy tales. Around 10:00 p.m. a countess comes to the inn together with her huntsman and her lady-in-waiting. The men inform the huntsman of the impending danger. Therefore, the countess goes to a room with her lady and the hunter joins the men to have better chances of defense in case of an attack.
After midnight, the robbers do indeed arrive. However, they are only after the countess. The robbers want to kidnap her so that her husband will have to ransom her. The young goldsmith, who is small and has no beard, lets himself be ""kidnapped"" instead of her, disguised as the countess. The hunter and the student get themselves captured with the goldsmith and accompany him.
While the countess goes back home unharmed and the carter continues on his way, the three prisoners are taken to the campsite of the band of robbers. After they have held out there for five days, the robber chief comes to them and explains how serious the situation is. The count does not pay the ransom, so the captain is forced to inflict pain on the supposed countess. However, it seems impossible for the robber captain to put the countess in danger, as he respects her very much. Therefore, he proposes to the prisoners to escape together with them as soon as it gets dark. So the goldsmith, the huntsman, the student and the captain wander all night long. When it gets light, the escaping prisoners meet five soldiers. Among them is a major who recognizes the hunter. The major brings the hunter and his fellow travelers safely to Aschaffenburg, where the count resides.
On the same day, the hunter, the goldsmith and the count travel to his castle, where the countess is waiting for good news from her rescuer. Accordingly, she is delighted when she sees the goldsmith. She asks him to let her keep her clothes and her sack, with which she had disguised herself in order not to be convicted by the robbers as the real Countess. He allows her to do so. However, he asks to be allowed to keep the jewelry of his godmother, whom he has never seen before. He wants to give it to her personally on his way. The countess looks at the jewelry and is very surprised when she recognizes it. They are the gems that she herself sent to her godson, who is a goldsmith and who was supposed to work them for her. Therefore, before her stands none other than her godson, who saved her life.
The Countess takes her godson into the family in gratitude. When he returns from his wanderings, she sets up a complete house for him in Nuremberg.","Many years ago, when the roads were still bad and not as frequently driven as now, two young bourgeois moved through this forest. He was eighteen years old and was a circlesmith. The other, a gold worker, could have almost sixteen years after his disappearance and made a week now lifting his first journey to the world. The evening was beautifully coming up, and the shadows of the vast fourth and the book shadows the narrow path on which the two walked. When the wind went out through the trees, it was like he heard trees behind him. When the dust walked and shared on the way, he believed to see faces rolling behind the bushes. In Würzburg, where he had learned, among his comrades he was considered an untouched bourgeois, whose heart was sitting on the right spot; But he was very courageous today. Often it was thought that he was followed by the circlesmith to go another station instead of staying at the entrance of the forest overnight. For example, because of my Sunday rock that I have in the run, or because of the junk of a tale? There you must be dressed in gold and silk, if they find it worth the effort to kill one.” “! But the young Goldschmidt said, you shouldn’t trust, maybe it could be a robbery. But the circlesmith taught them that the thieves had their houses or caves under the earth, and this must be the housing that a man described to them at the entrance of the forest. They could, if they are on the teeth eselin, ignore the dust. On the oven in a armchair was a man sleeping in his clothes after a driver and weekly the master of the car in front of the door. On the other side of the offend, a woman and a girl were sitting and spanning; Behind the table on the wall was a man who, a glass of wine in front of himself, had his head in his hands so that they could not see his face. But the circlesmidt [118] wanted to notice from his clothes that he must be a predecessor. When they still stood on the liver, a dog hit in the house; The mouth, the hand of the circle, answered, and a magd appeared in the door and looked out to the strangers. They were promised to be able to see and give beds. They entered and placed the heavy bonds, the stone and the skin in the corners, and sat to the Lord on the table. He turned up with her greeting, and they looked at a fine young man who thanked them gently for her greeting. “The throw of a beautiful horse is music in the ears of this division and attract them for an hour away; But if a few poor bears like us go through the forest, people to whom the thieves could give something themselves, they will not raise up their feet.” “This is a week true,” said the driver, who, awakened by the arrival of the strangers, had also entered the table. “A poor man can’t earn a lot for his money, but you’ve been playing that they’re just killing poor people or forcing them to fall under the band and serve as thieves.” “If this is the case with these people in the forest,” the young Goldschmidt notices, “so this house will really give us little look. The man is in his house, [119] They say they trade wine. But the woman is a quiet woman, who no one wants evil. “No, he is wrong, Lord!” “And yet,” the young man took the word, “but I didn’t like to reject as much what he said. Several of them had predicted that they would stay in this housing, and when after two or three weeks they did not hear anything of them, they searched their way, and they also asked here in the housing, there should no one be seen. It is suspicious.” “I know God,” the circle called, “there we acted more reasonably when we approached our night camp under the next best tree than here in these four walls, where there is no rise to think when they once occupied the door. For the windows are more rewarded.” They were all thoughtful through these speeches. It did not seem unlikely that the gifts in the forest, whether forced or voluntarily, were in agreement with the thieves. The young lord wanted to trave on his red through a secure, offensive valley, the circlesmidt wanted to do twelve of his handful companions, armed with knots, as the bodyguard, Felix, the gold worker, wore fear, more comfortable about the jewelry of his goodwill than about his life; But the driver, who was just thinking about the smoke of his pipe, said quietly, “Lord! Everything has to lie to me, or you’re a student, a bag.” “Not a cup,” the young man smiled, “but a student wants to travel in the distance to his home; But what is in our books is less to tell than what Eiche had and heard there. That’s why you always wake up if otherwise you like to listen to them.” “Even higher than a card game,” the driver tells me, “will be with me when one tells a beautiful story. Often I prefer to ride on the road in the worst step and obey one who goes next and tells something beautiful; I have taken some of them in the bad weather, under the condition that he tells me something, and I have a friend of me, I think, just because he knows stories that last seven hours and longer.” “That’s what I’m doing,” the young gold worker added, “I like to hear for my life, and my master in [121] Würzburg had to strictly prohibit my books, that I didn’t read too many stories and neglect the work about it. Don’t just give a nice price, circlesmidt, I know you could tell from now on until the day that your betrayal has gone out.” The circlesmith drunk to strengthen himself to his discretion, and then ask:",hDE-EN,0.3743718592964824,0.1494974874371859,0.4857807,0.49940473,0.49249852,-3.516032218933105,0.5407895536619391,-0.8473205,231-German_25-True-True-True,0.0,0.9558526277542114,0.1376644861435804,0.3262779278596298,0.2948423542402881,4.0

In a dark forest, they came to a small house, where a maiden warned them that her stepmother was a witch who disliked strangers, but unfortunately there was nowhere else for shelter.  The prince and his servant reluctantly entered the witch's house, but before they went to bed, the maiden warned the prince and his servant not to eat or drink anything the witch gave them because it might be poisonous. The next morning, the witch gave the prince's servant a poisonous drink, telling him to give it to his master, but the servant ended up spilling it on the prince's horse, killing it.
When he told the prince what had happened and they came to the dead horse, a raven was already eating the corpse. Deciding they may not find better food that day, the servant killed the bird and took it with him. Next, they reached an inn and the servant gave the innkeeper the raven to make food of it. Unknown to the prince and his servant, the inn was really a robbers' den. The robbers returned, and, before killing the travellers, sat down to eat. Immediately after eating a few bites of the raven soup the innkeeper had prepared, the robbers fell down dead from the poison that the raven had in its body. The innkeeper's daughter then showed the prince and his servant the robbers' hidden treasure, but the prince insisted that the daughter keep it.
Continuing on, the prince and his servant next came to a town where a princess would marry any man who asked her a riddle that she could not solve. If she could solve it, the man's head would be cut off. The prince asked the princess, ""What slew none, and yet slew twelve?"" The princess could not solve the riddle, so she sent her maid to see if the prince revealed the riddle while talking in his sleep. The prince was prepared, however, because that night he had his servant sleep in his bed. When the maid came in, the servant ripped off her robe and chased her out.  Next, the princess sent her chambermaid to spy on the prince while he was asleep, but the prince's servant also ripped off her robe and chased her out. On the third night, the prince slept in his own bed, and the princess herself came in. The prince pretended to be asleep and the princess asked him the answer to the riddle. After the prince revealed the answer, the princess departed, but left her robe behind.
The next morning, the princess announced the answer of the riddle: ""A raven ate from a dead, poisoned horse, and died from it. Then, twelve robbers ate the raven and died from that.""

Now she was beautiful like milk and blood, that no one looked at the danger, and one after the other came with his mystery, but she redeemed it every time. And when they had made a good cloth for each other, it came to pass that a merchant son heard of the commandment and decided to go with him, and his servant, who was wise, should go with him and help him. Four eyes, he thought, see more comfortable than two, we want to be beautifully hit, fresh bold, is half won. But the Father and Mother, as they heard of it, were in great faithfulness, and because they believed that their beloved child must die there, they did not want to let their children go and said, “It is better that he dies and be buried with us than in the stranger.” Thus they drowned poison into the goodbye wine and said, “Love Son, drink for the last time with us,” but it was as if he noticed the intentions, because he didn’t want to drink, but he raised the horse and said: “Lives a week, dear parents, I have to go, and another wins the beautiful Virgin.” Then they raised the glass to him, that he should drink with force; but he gave the horse the sporns, that the wine sprinkled and sprinkled the horse into the ear. When they had run for a while, the horse fell away, and the Lord wanted to sit on the servant’s horse, and the servant had to walk behind the three and carry the bond on his back. Now the rabbits lay down on the dead horse and eat it, but because the flesh was poisoned, they will also be poisoned and soon die.

And he gave them a little hake and baked three bread from it. The next morning they came through a forest in a thick cloud, where twelve spiders jumped and held the Lord and the servants. The servant said, “Let us live, we have no money, but three breads we will give you.” Those were satisfied, they took the bread, they shared among themselves and ate them.

The next morning she said, “I’ve guessed the mystery,” and let the twelve judges come and solve it before them. But the young man asked for an ear from them and said, ""If they had not gotten in the night and had asked me, they would not know.""

If he shot among them, one would die and they would drop the cloak that turned out to be a wishing cloak. Furthermore, if he swallowed the heart of the dead bird, he would find a gold coin by his pillow every morning.
He went out into the world and came to a castle where an old witch lived with her beautiful daughter. The witch knew about the bird's heart and told her daughter what she must do to steal it. She gave the man a drink, and the bird's heart came up. The daughter swallowed it herself. Then the witch told her that she had to steal the wishing cloak as well, and how to do it. The daughter looked at the Garnet Mountain and told the huntsman that she wished she were there. He took her under the cloak and wished them both there. He slept there and she stole the cloak and wished herself back home.
Three giants saw him and talked of killing him, but the third said that a cloud would carry him away. He climbed up the mountain and rode off on a cloud. It took him to a cabbage/lettuce garden. He was so hungry that he ate some, and it turned him into a donkey. He went on and found a different patch of cabbage/lettuce which turned him back into a man. He took both kinds of vegetables and went back to the castle. He told the witch that he was a royal messenger sent to fetch the finest vegetables for the king, but he was afraid that the heat would make it wither. The witch asked for some. He gave it to her and she, her maidservant, and the daughter all ate the cooked vegetables and became donkeys. The huntsman sold them to a miller, telling him to give the old one (the witch) one meal a day and three beatings, the younger one (the maidservant) three meals and two beatings, and the youngest (the witch's daughter) three meals and one beating.
After a time, he came back to the miller to see how the donkeys were doing. The miller told him that the oldest donkey was dead, but the two younger donkeys were so sad he thought they would die. The huntsman bought them back and turned them back into women. The witch's daughter told him where the cloak was and said she would give him back the heart as it had been stolen, but he said it would make no difference, if they wed, so they married shortly afterwards.","There was once a young hunter who had a fresh and joyful heart and went to the forest to stand up, and as he went so and pfiff on the sheet, therefore a old, ugly mother came, speaking to Eichen and said, “Good day, dear hunter, you are a week of good things, but I apologize for hunger and thirst, give me an almosen.” Then the hunter took the poor motherhood, that he took into his pocket and sought something for his wealth. Now he wanted to go further, but the old woman stopped and said, ""Listen, my dear hunting, what I tell you, for your good heart I will give you a gift, just go always your way, over which you will come to a tree, on which faithful birds sit and cry around a mantle. Take the mantle with you, it’s a desire mantle, if you throw your eyes around your shoulders, you just need to wish yourself in one place, thought, done and you’re there. But cut the dead bird up and take out the heart, and drank it all, and then you will be able to lift all and every morning, when you rise, gold under your head, and this comes to you because of the heart of the bird.” The hunter thanked the wise woman and thought to himself, “Beautiful things, cry all of this!” But as he had gone about a hundred steps, he heard a scream and a scream over himself in the ashes, that he looked up, and he saw a crowd of birds riding around with their scratches and their feet, crying, watching, and whispering, as if they wanted to have each one alone. “The hunter said, that’s wonderful, it’s coming, as the mother said,” he took the boxes from the shoulder, placed it, and made his shot in the middle, so that the feathers flown around. Then the hunter did as the old man had swallowed him, cut the bird up, searched for the heart, swallowed it down, and took the mantle with him to the house. The next morning, when he woke up, the promise came to him and he wanted to see if the promise came to him. It came to pass that one day he came through a thick forest and, as it was over, there was a remarkable closure in a height before him. But the old man was a witch and said to the girl: “There comes a man from the forest, who has a wonderful shame in the body, which we must praise for, my heartbreaker, that’s better for us than him,” and put a drink and, as it was cooked, she made yours in [175] a cup and gave yours to the girl, which had yours to be enough for the hunter. He said, “My dear, drink me.” Then he took the cup, and as he had swallowed the drink, he broke the heart of the bird out of the body. Only the birds that fly will come, a man no longer.” “This is all your room,” said the hunter, “I will soon take it from your heart.” He caught her under his mantle and desired to go over the granate mountain, and at the moment they both sat on it. As he was sleeping, then he banded his mantle from his shoulders and went around, read the names and stones, and hoped to go home. But when the hunter had prayed for his sleep and woke up, he saw that Eugen had worn his loved ones and left him alone on the wild mountains. Now the giants passed, and the first hit Eichen with his foot, and said, ""What is there for a roof of earth and looked inside?"" The two said, “Tet yours dead!” The third said, “It would be worth the effort. Let the Eyes only live, he climbs higher to the mountains, so the Eyes bak the clouds and carry the Eyes on."" During this conversation they passed, but the hunter had noticed their words, and as soon as they were gone, he stood up and climbed the mountain peak. Now the hunter lay down and slept out of his tiredness, and when he woke up the next morning, he broke a head out of the evil and the good salas, and thought, “This will help me back to the Meni and punish the faithfulness.” Then he set his heads and climbed over the wall and went on to look for the end of his beloved. When he walked a few days, he was so happy to find it. When he was finished, she could not wait until it stood on the table, but she took just a few leaves and put them in the mouth; But they were hardly swallowed, so was also the human shape lost, and it went down as an eseline into the garden. The boat was sitting at the time with the beautiful girl, and when no one came with the salad, and there was also lust after it, he said: “I don’t know where the salad is.” Then the hunter thought, “It’s going to be a good thing,” and said, “I’m going to go to the kitchen once,” and as he came down, he saw the two elephants running around in the courtyard and the salas lie on the ground. “Well right,” he said, “the two have a small part away!” and he lifted the remaining leaves up, put them on the shell and brought them to the girl. Now the hunter washed his face and went down into the garden, so that the Eyes could recognize the transformed and said: “Today you shall receive the reward for your untruth.” Then he binding them all three on a seal and pushed them forward until he came to a mould, and knocked the mould to the window. After a few days, the Müller came and said, “He had to report that the old Eselin, who had only been hit and had nothing to eat, would have died; And the other two, he continued, although they are not dead and get to eat, but they are so sad that it can’t last long with them.” Then the hunter mercyed and let all the anger run, and said to the mullers that he should kill them again. And when they came, he gave them to eat of the good salad, so that they became humans again. Your desire mantle is hanging in a barrier and for the bird heart I want to take a breach drink.” Then he thought differently and said, “Let’s keep it, it’s just one, for I’m going to accept you as my faithful spouse.” And there were marriages held, and they lived pleased with each other until their death.",hDE-EN,0.3696328562538892,0.1804604853764779,0.53652126,0.5331378,0.5348242,-3.196507692337036,0.565815568373375,-0.07413882,272-German_25-True-True-True,0.1805987755307061,0.9037293791770936,0.4665972513673895,0.4726243197239019,0.4716198083311498,6.0

The youngest went into a great woods, and a storm struck, so he sought shelter in a house.  The old woman there warned him that it is a den of robbers, but he stayed, and when the robbers arrived, he persuaded them to take him on as a servant.
They set him to prove himself by stealing an ox that a man brought to market to sell.  He took a shoe with a silver buckle and left it in the road.  The man saw it and thought it would be good if only he had the other, and went on.  The son took the shoe and ran through the countryside, to leave it in the road again. The man left his ox and went back to find the other, and the son drove the ox off.
The man went back to get the second ox to sell it, and the robbers told the son that if he stole that one as well, they would take him into the band.  The son hanged himself up along the way, and when the man passed, ran on and hanged himself again, and then a third time, until the man was half-convinced that it was witchcraft and went back to see if the first two bodies were still hanging, and the son drove off his ox.
The man went for his third and last ox, and the robbers said that they would make him the band's leader if he stole it.  The son made a sound like an ox bellowing in the woods, and the man, thinking it was his stolen oxen, ran off, leaving the third behind, and the son stole that one as well.
The robbers were not pleased with his leading the band, and so they all left him.  The son drove the oxen out, so they returned to their owner, took all the treasure in the house, and returned to his father.
He decided to marry the daughter of a local squire and sent his father to ask for her hand, telling him to tell the squire that he was a Master Thief.  The squire agreed, if the son could steal the roast from the spit on Sunday.  The son caught three hares and released them near the squire's kitchen, and the people there, thinking it was one hare, went out to catch it, and the son got in and stole the roast.

The priest made fun of him, and when the Master Thief came to claim his reward, the squire asked him to prove his skill further, by playing some trick on the priest. The Master Thief dressed up as an angel and convinced the priest that he was come to take him to heaven.  He dragged the priest over stones and thorns and threw him into the goose-house, telling him it was purgatory, and then stole all his treasure.
The squire was pleased, but still put off the Master Thief, telling him to steal twelve horses from his stable, with twelve grooms in their saddles.  The Master Thief prepared and disguised himself as an old woman to take shelter in the stable, and when the night grew cold, drank brandy against it.  The grooms demanded some, and he gave them a drugged drink, putting them to sleep, and stole the horses.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal a horse while he was riding it.  The Master Thief said he could, and disguised himself as an old man with a cask of mead, and put his finger in the hole, in place of the tap.  The squire rode up and asked him if he would look in the woods, to be sure that the Master Thief did not lurk there.  The Master Thief said that he could not, because he had to keep the mead from spilling, and the squire took his place and lent him his horse to look.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal the sheet off his bed and his wife's shift. The Master Thief made up a dummy like a man and put it at the window, and the squire shot at it.  The Master Thief let it drop.  Fearing talk, the squire went to bury it, and the Master Thief, pretending to be the squire, got the sheet and the shift on the pretext they were needed to clean the blood up.
The squire decided that he was too afraid of what the thief would steal next, and let him marry his daughter.","One day, a old man sat in front of a poor house with his wife, and wanted to rest a little from work. Then suddenly came a magnificent car with four raps, from which a rich-dressed man came up. “On the face hard,” the farmer replied, “but he has a sign on himself, a mothermark on his shoulder, which is like a bean.” In these words, the stranger pulled the rock out, throwed his shoulder, and showed the farmer the bean. I am going to go to him today.” As the evening time approached, the master was sitting in his car, and went to the closet. The raft received youren with activity because he kept youren for a man doing. He placed the veil on a cage, which he took on his back, and went with suspicious, fluctuating steps to the closet of the grass. It was nice dark when he got, he sat in the yard on a stone, began to house like an old breast sick woman, and kissed his hands as if he was frying. “Comrades,” one of those sitting in the stall called, “here is a mother-in-law, that has wine, that is as old as she herself, take a drink, that heats your stomach even better than our fire.” The old man was wearing wipes in the stall. One had set himself on the seated body horse, the other held the yard in his hand, [483] A rider had packed the wing. The one who was sitting in the seat was still sitting, but he bowed with his head almost up to the horse of the horse, and bleed with his mouth like a thumb ball. When the master saw that he was happy, he gave one a seal in his hand instead of the yard, and the other, who had held the wing, a straw. But what should he begin with the one who was sitting on the horse’s back? But he knew the good advice, and he scratched the seat, and attached a few wings hanging in rings on the wall to the seat, and pulled the sleeping rider with the seat up, and then he scratched the wings around the seat, and fixed them. When the day was taken, the master jumped on the stunned horse to the lock. When he was so high that the head of the deceased appeared in the window, the raft, which laughs in his bed, threw a pistol on the eyen: As soon as the master dropped the poor sinner, the head himself jumped down and hid himself in a corner. There he began to burial into a hole in which he wanted to put an eagle. “Dear lady,” he began with the voice of the grain, “the thief is dead, but he is my bite, and he was a shell like a bad weight: I don’t want to give price to the public shame, even with the poor parents I have compassion. What took the raft for a long face, when the master came the next morning, and brought him the bedduck and the ring. When the night was taken, he went to the village church with a long bag on his back, a bundle under his arm, and a lottery in his hand. In the bag he had cancer, but in the bundle short human. He sat on the godsacker, took out a cancer, and wrapped a whiskey on his back. Then he burned the light, put the cancer on the ground, and left the Greeks. He took one two out of the pocket, did the same with this, and continued until the last was out of the pocket. At the same time the master bands the bag up, backs your eyes at the building, and slides your eyes down the chain trap: as many times the heads of the two doors hang up on the stairs, he calls, “Now you go beautifully over the mountains.” Then he pulled them through the pot in the same way, and when they came through the pits, he called, “Today it’s going beautifully through the naked clouds,” and when he finally lifted them up the closing stairs, he called, “Today we’re on the sky stairs, and soon we’ll be in the fortress.” When he had reached the top, he set the bag into the tail, and when the tails flattered, he said, “Hears the angels rejoice and strike with the fitiches.” Then he set the rope in front and went. The next morning he went to the grain, and told him that he had solved the third task, and brought the priest and the coastman out of the church. “They are in a bag on the top of the tail, and they are in the heavens.” The raft rose up himself, and convinced himself that he had said the truth.

When they ask what it is, a farmer tells them that their mayor has bought this so-called moon and that he pours oil on it every day for a fee to keep it shining.
The boys decide to steal the moon and take it back to their country. There they also hang it on an oak tree and demand an appropriate fee from the community. As the boys grow old and realize that they will soon die, they decide one by one that each of them would like to take a quarter of the moon to his grave. In this way, the moon reaches the underworld, where its unfamiliar light awakens the dead. These become active again and begin to amuse themselves loudly. When St. Peter becomes aware of this noise, he calls together the heavenly hosts, believing that the dead are attacking.
Since there is no attack, St. Peter personally goes to the underworld, calms the dead and takes the moon to heaven, where he hangs it up.","In the early days there was a land where the night was always dark, and the heavens were directed over it like a black tail, for there never came the moon up, and no star blinked in the darkness. When the world was created, the nightlight was directed. From this land, once four bourgeois went to the march and slowly into a different kingdom, where at night, when the sun was gone behind the mountains, a bright ball stood on an eggs tree, which wiped away and wide a soft light. The walkers stood quietly and asked a farmer who passed with his car what this light was. “This is the moon,” he replied, “this is the moon that our scholarship bought Eichen for three Tale and fixed it on the Eich tree. He must throw oil every day and keep the eyes clean so that he always burns light. For this he receives a tale from us every week.” When the farmers had gone, one of them said, “This lamp we might need, we have a tree in the house that is so big that we can hang it. What a joy if we don’t get around in the darkness at night!” “Do you know what?” said the two, “We want to hole cars and horses and take the moon away. You can buy another one here.” “I can climb well,” said the third, “I want to hole well down.” The fourth brought a wagon with horses, and the third climbed the tree up, [352] broke a hole into the moon, pulled a seal through, and drove the eagles down. When the bright ball was on the car, they covered a thumb on it so that no one should notice the robbery. They brought yours happily into the soil land and yours eselin on a high soil. Old and young were glad when the faithful lamp laid light over all fields and filled the dust and the chambers with it. The worms came out of the rocky hills, and the little peasants danced in their red rocks on the knowledge the ring dance. The four supplied the moon with oil, washed the roof and received their tale weekly. But they became an old journey, and when he saw a sick man and his death, he ordered that the fourth part of the moon as his property should be given to him in the grave. When he was dead, the schoolhead went up on the tree and cut down with the heck shell a quarter that was placed in the shell. When the two died, the two quarters were given to him, and the light diminished. It was even weaker after the death of the third, who also took his part, and when the fourth came into the tomb, the old darkness came back. When the people walked out at night without lights, they collided with their heads. But when the parts of the moon in the underworld reunited again, where darkness had ruled, the dead became unhappy and awakened from their sleep. They returned when they could see again: the moon light was enough for them, because their eyes were so weak that they would not be able to tolerate the brightness of the sun. The heal.

Then there was a great noise that the woman came out, and when she saw the wolf, she called her people, who came and defeated Eyes, who wanted to keep things, that he came out to fear in the forest with two thin legs, and cried, and said, “What did you bring me, the farmers have raised me, and my skin will die.” But the fearful answered, “Why are you such a nimmersat?” On the third day, when they were out together, and the wolf hardly thought, he said again, “Give me something to eat, or I’m cooking you!” The fearful answered, “I know a man who has slaughtered and salted meat in the gel, that we will hole.” The wolf said, “But I want to go right away, so that you can help me if I can’t go.” Because of me, the fear test said, and showed him the slices and paths on which they finally slowly into the glands. Then the flesh was in the desert, and the wolf made it, and thought, “Then I stop, have time.” The fear made the Seyches taste well, looking around, and often rushed to the hole through which they were getting, and tried to see if his body would be small enough to go through. The wolf said, “Let you be afraid, oh, what did you thus go and go and jump out and in?” “I have to see if no one comes,” he replied quietly, but not to fall. Then the wolf said, “I will not go further than until the cat is taught.” Then the farmer, who had heard the noise of fear springs, came into the gels. The fearful, as he saw, was with a look to the hole out. The wolf wanted to go, but he had eaten so thick that he could not go through, but remained stained.

The father sends his sons to fetch water for her, in the German version to be baptized, in the Greek version to take water from a healing spring. In their haste, they drop the jug in the well. When they do not return, their father thinks that they have gone off to play and curses them and so they turn into ravens.
When the sister is grown, she sets out in search of her brothers. She attempts to get help first from the sun, which is too hot, then the moon, which craves human flesh, and then the morning star. The star helps her by giving her a chicken bone (in the German) or a bat's foot (in the Greek) and tells her she will need it to save her brothers. She finds them on the Glass Mountain. In the Greek version, she opens it with the bat's foot, in the German, she has lost the bone, and chops off a finger to use as a key, (or she opens it with chicken bone). She goes into the mountain, where a dwarf tells her that her brothers will return. She takes some of their food and drink and leaves in the last cup a ring from home.
When her brothers return, she hides. They turn back into human form and ask who has been at their food. The youngest brother finds the ring, and hopes it is their sister, in which case they are saved. She emerges, and they return home.","A man had seven sons and still no daughters, so secher first desired, finally gave him his wife good hope for a boy and how it came out of the world. You were a girl. Even if it was beautiful, it was also gentle and small and should have the need tower because of its weakness. Then the Father quickly sent one of the boys a source to hole water, but the other six went with them. But each one wanted to be the first in the creation, and on it the crown fell to them in the fountain. Those who stood there demanded and did not know what they should do, and no one trusted themselves home. The father was worried for a while, the girl had to divide untouchedly and didn’t know why the boys stayed so long. “He said, you’ve forgotten a game again, and when they didn’t come, he fled in the arrow: “I wanted all the boys to be rabbits.” As soon as the word had been spoken, he heard a heavy blow over his head in the air, looking up, and saw seven cold-black rabbits flying out of it. The parents could not take the dishonesty more comfortably, and so sad they were about the departure of their seven sons, they were somewhat comforted by a lovely daughter, which soon came to power and became more beautiful with every day. He did not even know for a long time that there were brothers, for [134] the parents had to mention them before him until one day he heard about the people speak of themselves: Yes, she would be a nice week, but it was actually guilt that her seven brothers became unhappy through her. And she was deeply troubled, and went to the Father and Mother, and asked if she had brothers, and where would they go? Now the parents were no longer permitted to hide the secret, but they said that it was so from heaven, and their birth was only the innocent occasion. Only the girl was aware of it every day and believed to be firmly connected to solve her brothers and sisters, and had no rest and grass until she secretly opened up and went to the widespread world to find her brothers somewhere and, at the expense of what she wanted, to freeze? She took nothing with her but a ringleep from her parents, a lean bread for hunger, a craving water for thirst, and a stool for fatigue. It was always far, far, far, until the end of the world. Then the sun came down, but it was too hot and feared, and it ate the little children. He went away and went to the moon, but it was too cold and cruel and evil, and when he noticed the child, he said, “I smell, I smell of human meat.” Then it went forward and came to the stars, which were friendly and good to him, and each was sitting on his special chair. But the morning star stood up, gave him a corner and said, “If you don’t have the walking chain, [135] You can’t lock into the Glasberg, and in the Glasberg there are your brothers. “ The girl took the walking chain, wrapped it a week in a rubber and went on again until it came to the glass mountain, whose door was closed. Now it wanted to hole the wing chain, but as it opened the wing, it was learned, and it had lost the gift of the good stars. What should it begin now, his brothers wanted to save it and had no key to the Glasberg? The good sister took a knife, cut off his little finger, put it into the door and concluded happily. When it had entered, a cowboy came to him and said, “My child, what are you looking for?” “I’m looking for my brothers the seven rabbits,” he replied. The serpent said, “The Lord Rabbi is not at home, but if you want to wait so long until they come, then enter.” Then the womb brought the food of the rabbits on seven tables and in seven shapes, and from each tables the sister eaten a brochure, and from each shapes it drank a brochure. But in the last shape it dropped the ring that it took with it. Suddenly, there was a heavy and a wicked voice in the air, and the cowboy said: “Now the lords of Rabbi come to escape home.” Then they came and wanted to eat and drink, and sought their tables and strengths, and said one by another: “Who has eaten my tables? Who has drank out of my strength? This was a man’s mouth.” And when the seventh came to the ground, the ring fell against him, and he looked at him, and realized that he was of father and mother, and said, ""God give, our little sister would be there, so we would be saved.""

The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.","Once upon a time, an old king had a daughter who was the most beautiful young woman in the world. He announced that whoever could stay in his old castle for three nights would win the princess's hand in marriage.

The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear.

The father wants to keep the youngest and weakest one with him, but he answers with trust in God, because he was in church. The father is impressed and concludes with the poem:

He then instructed each of his sons about the dangers they might face and how to avoid them. The youngest son had stayed with his father and was encouraged to continue doing so, but he argued that if he lived honestly and without harming others, he would be safe. He had learned this from hearing sermons in a church.

After waking up the next morning and saying his prayers, he found the shoes completely finished and perfectly well-made in his workbench. A customer soon entered the store and offered more than the usual price, for he was fond of the pair. One evening, shortly before Christmas, the shoemaker said to his wife, ""Why don't we stay up tonight and see who is giving us this helping hand,"" and his wife agreed. Hiding in a corner of the room, they saw two little men working quickly and nimbly on the shoes, then running away after their work was completely finished.

The next morning, his wife said, ""The little men have made us wealthy. We must show them our thanks. They are running around with nothing on, freezing."" She proposed to make clothes, and the shoemaker agreed to make a pair of shoes for each of them. The two of them did not stop until they had finished the work, then hid themselves again.

Second tale
A poor hardworking servant girl was sweeping out the house and shaking the sweepings onto a large pile when she found a letter on the pile.

The girl hesitated at first, but her master finally convinced her to accept.

Then the servant girl was led by the elves to their hollow mountain, where everything was smaller but also more splendidly ornamented.

The elves did everything to make her happy during those three days, but the girl again asked to leave. The little men gave her gold and let her leave their mountain.

Then, she says to herself, ""How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony."" Sometime later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth.A year later, Snow White's father, the king, marries again. His new wife is a very beautiful, but also vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that response because the magic mirror never lies. But when Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White learns of her stepmother's evil plan she tearfully begs the huntsman, ""Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!"" After seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of an animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once again: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

In the courtyard, there was a well with clear water. The eldest daughter went to get a glass of water, but it was murky.

The third daughter promised to be the frog's friend if he made the water clear. After she drank the water, the frog followed her back to the castle and slept at the foot of her bed for three nights. On the third night, he turned into a prince because she kept her promise. They got married, and the other sisters regretted not taking the frog as their friend.",hDE-EN,0.3694267515923567,0.178343949044586,0.5375632,0.5186606,0.5279427,-3.5218958854675293,0.5410497951419925,-0.790141,100-German_100,1.11322888450906,0.904330551624298,0.1750430166357475,0.3893119476576724,0.3536004591540182,13.0

During this hike, one evening he and a circular smith accompanying him stop at an inn, where he meets a student and a wagoner. This inn is located in the Spessart region, which is notorious for robberies. The four men decide not to go to bed in order to avoid being robbed. In order not to be overcome by sleep, they tell each other four fairy tales. Around 10:00 p.m. a countess comes to the inn together with her huntsman and her lady-in-waiting. The men inform the huntsman of the impending danger. Therefore, the countess goes to a room with her lady and the hunter joins the men to have better chances of defense in case of an attack.
After midnight, the robbers do indeed arrive. However, they are only after the countess. The robbers want to kidnap her so that her husband will have to ransom her. The young goldsmith, who is small and has no beard, lets himself be ""kidnapped"" instead of her, disguised as the countess. The hunter and the student get themselves captured with the goldsmith and accompany him.
While the countess goes back home unharmed and the carter continues on his way, the three prisoners are taken to the campsite of the band of robbers. After they have held out there for five days, the robber chief comes to them and explains how serious the situation is. The count does not pay the ransom, so the captain is forced to inflict pain on the supposed countess. However, it seems impossible for the robber captain to put the countess in danger, as he respects her very much. Therefore, he proposes to the prisoners to escape together with them as soon as it gets dark. So the goldsmith, the huntsman, the student and the captain wander all night long. When it gets light, the escaping prisoners meet five soldiers. Among them is a major who recognizes the hunter. The major brings the hunter and his fellow travelers safely to Aschaffenburg, where the count resides.
On the same day, the hunter, the goldsmith and the count travel to his castle, where the countess is waiting for good news from her rescuer. Accordingly, she is delighted when she sees the goldsmith. She asks him to let her keep her clothes and her sack, with which she had disguised herself in order not to be convicted by the robbers as the real Countess. He allows her to do so. However, he asks to be allowed to keep the jewelry of his godmother, whom he has never seen before. He wants to give it to her personally on his way. The countess looks at the jewelry and is very surprised when she recognizes it. They are the gems that she herself sent to her godson, who is a goldsmith and who was supposed to work them for her. Therefore, before her stands none other than her godson, who saved her life.
The Countess takes her godson into the family in gratitude. When he returns from his wanderings, she sets up a complete house for him in Nuremberg.","Two young men, a goldsmith and a carpenter, were travelling through the Spessart forest when they became worried about the possibility of being robbed.

The next morning, the witch gave the prince's servant a poisonous drink, telling him to give it to his master, but the servant ended up spilling it on the prince's horse, killing it.
